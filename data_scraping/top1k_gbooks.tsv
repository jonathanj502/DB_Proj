1	The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)	Suzanne Collins	2008	 Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.	374	en	https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1447303603m/2767052.jpg

3	Pride and Prejudice	Jane Austen	2001	Elizabeth Bennet is Austen’s most liberated and unambiguously appealing heroine, and Pride and Prejudice has remained over most of the past two centuries Austen’s most popular novel. The story turns on the marriage prospects of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet: Elizabeth forms a prejudice against the proud and distant Mr. Darcy; Darcy’s charming friend Charles Bingley falls in love with her sister Jane; and the handsome officer George Wickham forms attachments successively to Elizabeth and to her sister Lydia. Irvine’s extensive introduction sets the novel in the context of the literary and intellectual history of the period, and deals with such crucial background issues as early-nineteenth century class relations in Britain, and female exclusion from property and power. The appendices present an unrivaled selection of background contextual documents.	502	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mxDLY0qL2mAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

14	Wuthering Heights	Emily Brontë	2020	'You said I killed you - haunt me, then!' Wuthering Heights is one of the most famous love stories in the English language. It is also one of the most potent revenge narratives. The intense and unbreakable bond between the fiery Catherine Earnshaw and the foundling Heathcliff has startled and fascinated readers since its first publication in 1847. Of uncertain parentage and ethnicity, Heathcliff comes to Wuthering Heights as a child when Catherine's father finds him wandering alone through the slave-trading port of Liverpool. After Mr Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff and Catherine find refuge in each other when the household falls into the hands of Catherine's dissolute older brother. Their bond deepens as they escape together from the violence and stern religion of their home to the Yorkshire moors. But the story of Catherine and Heathcliff's attachment transforms from intimacy to strife when Catherine marries the refined Edgar Linton. The ensuing story of violence and thwarted passion is one of the most powerful tales of the gothic tradition, a literary mode from which Emily Brontë wrings all of its terrifying potential. A regional novel with a global reach, a work of sensational effects with a startling ethical core, Wuthering Heights is both a romantic melodrama and wrenching study of the difficulty of escaping from the legacies of violence. This edition reproduces the authoritative Clarendon text, with revised and expanded notes and a selection from the poems of Emily Brontë.	417	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4Zn9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

20	The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion	John Helfers	2012	The definitive truth within Dan Brown's fantastic fiction—revealed at last. With millions of copies of his books in print, a major motion picture based on The Da Vinci Code in theaters, and religious leaders everywhere launching scathing attacks on his work, Dan Brown is, quite simply, a phenomenon. His novels, intricate mosaics combining well-researched facts with action-packed storytelling, have created their own industry of location tours, seminars—even PBS specials. But perhaps the one thing that still keeps his readers guessing is that nagging question: How much of this is true? The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion tells all. Unlike the avalanche of books specifically about The Da Vinci Code , The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion covers all of Dan Brown's books and, crucially, has no religious agenda or political axe to grind—these are the facts. • Could there actually be an unbreakable code that would cripple US intelligence, as in Digital Fortress? • How much truth lies in The Da Vinci Code's history-altering propositions that have so angered the Vatican? • Are the Illuminati from Angels and Demons really alive and well? The answers are here, covering every picture, place, proper name, and historical event through all of Brown's books, explaining what's absolutely true, possible, improbable, or completely fictitious. One of Dan Brown's greatest accomplishments as a writer is his uncanny ability to blur the line between fact and fiction. Now, with The Unauthorized Dan Brown Companion, readers will at last have all of the information to distinguish for themselves between the inventions of a master storyteller and the historical revelations of a first-rate investigator. John Helfers is a full-time writer and editor currently living on Green Bay, Wisconsin. He is the co-editor of The Valdemar Companion, a guide to the work and life of fantasy writer Mercedes Lackey. Recent published books include two anthologies he edited, In the Shadow of Evil and Slipstreams. He has also written nonfiction, with his history of the United States Navy, The Alpha Bravo Delta Guide to the U.S. Navy, published in 2003.	310	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_v1QMucvtUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
21	Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass and Alice’s Adventures Under Ground	Lewis Carroll	2016	Originally conceived by its author as an entertaining story for Alice Liddell, the daughter of an Oxford dean, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the fantastic tale of the young Alice's encounters with the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts, has captured the imaginations of young and old throughout the world since it was first published in 1865.

22	Crime and Punishment	Fyodor Dostoyevsky	2008	Could an ordinary person, with no hint of malice and no motive but discovering what it feels like to do it, plot to kill and then actually murder a total stranger? What if the stranger were a thoroughly unlikable person hated by everyone who came into contact with her? One of the great novels of world literature, Crime and Punishment is a thriller of the conscience, one that wrangles with morality and its uses-or lack thereof-in the depths of poverty. Russian novelist FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOEVSKY (1821-1881) conceived the character of his putative hero, the impoverished student Raskolnikov, while he himself was struggling under the burden of massive debt, and turned his ethical dilemmas into a literary detective story of the highest order, one in which the criminal seeks to discover his own motives for his terrible deed. Renowned for its invention of a more intimate kind of third-person narration, and featuring narrative manipulations of time and memory that anticipate the works of authors such as Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce, this classic novel remains essential reading for all lovers of great literature. This edition presents the acclaimed 1914 translation by English writer CONSTANCE CLARA GARNETT (1861-1946), who introduced many of the great Russian novelists to the British and American public.	1090	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0HZrq-4zA5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

35	Charlotte's Web	E. B. White, Kate DiCamillo	1952	Sixty years ago, on October 15, 1952, E.B. White's Charlotte's Web was published. It's gone on to become one of the most beloved children's books of all time. To celebrate this milestone, the renowned Newbery Medalist Kate DiCamillo has written a heartfelt and poignant tribute to the book that is itself a beautiful translation of White's own view of the world—of the joy he took in the change of seasons, in farm life, in the miracles of life and death, and, in short, the glory of everything. We are proud to include Kate DiCamillo's foreword in the 60th anniversary editions of this cherished classic. Charlotte's Web is the story of a little girl named Fern who loved a little pig named Wilbur—and of Wilbur's dear friend Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful large grey spider who lived with Wilbur in the barn. With the help of Templeton, the rat who never did anything for anybody unless there was something in it for him, and by a wonderfully clever plan of her own, Charlotte saved the life of Wilbur, who by this time had grown up to quite a pig. How all this comes about is Mr. White's story. It is a story of the magic of childhood on the farm. The thousands of children who loved Stuart Little, the heroic little city mouse, will be entranced with Charlotte the spider, Wilbur the pig, and Fern, the little girl who understood their language. The forty-seven black-and-white drawings by Garth Williams have all the wonderful detail and warmhearted appeal that children love in his work. Incomparably matched to E.B. White's marvelous story, they speak to each new generation, softly and irresistibly.	202	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R5m50H3KVqEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

37	Fahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury	Ray Bradbury	2020	"Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper spontaneously catches fire and burns. It is a futuristic novel describing a time when the government has ordered that all books be burned. This may seem to be ridiculous and could never be happening, but it is starting to happen in real life now, today. Now we have a president who accuses everything in the press of being ""fake news"". He tells his followers who constitute a near majority never to believe the news media. He has ordered the arrest and criminal prosecution of the leading law enforcement officers including the Director of the FBI and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He has accused most of his political opponents of corruption and crime. Nobody knows what is the truth and what is false any more. He says that decisions of the highest courts of the United States are almost all fake. He openly attacks and criticizes the highest judges of the Supreme Court. He says the truth is false and the false is true. The result is we the people do not know who or what to believe. All the great scientists have found that climate change is real and our time on this earth may be limited, but he says climate change is a hoax and we should ignore the works of the scientists. This is not the first time this has happened. In China, Chairman Mao declared his Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forwards. China has the oldest civilization in the world, going back to before Confucius in 551-479 BC. Yet, during the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao ordered all the old books burned and destroyed and even ordered the people to destroy their old household furniture. I found this out myself in 2011 when I toured China after the World Memory Championships in Guangzhou China. As a book publisher, I wanted to reprint some old classical works. I was shocked to discover that no books were available dated before 1949 and few after that. Everything earlier than that had been destroyed. I am still hoping that some older Chinese books have been preserved in Taiwan. I consider a book dated 1949 to be a relatively new book. I usually do not bother with such recent books. The destruction of all books in China dated before 1949 is not reported on any website that I have found but I saw with my own eyes that all such books were gone."	216	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UGVrzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

No one ever said life was easy. But Ponyboy is pretty sure that he's got things figured out. He knows that he can count on his brothers, Darry and Sodapop. And he knows that he can count on his friends—true friends who would do anything for him, like Johnny and Two-Bit. But not on much else besides trouble with the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids whose idea of a good time is beating up on “greasers” like Ponyboy. At least he knows what to expect—until the night someone takes things too far. The Outsiders is a dramatic and enduring work of fiction that laid the groundwork for the YA genre. S. E. Hinton's classic story of a boy who finds himself on the outskirts of regular society remains as powerful today as it was the day it was first published.

48	1984	George Orwell	2024	"""1984"" by George Orwell is a dystopian masterpiece that paints a chilling vision of a totalitarian future. Set in a world where Big Brother watches your every move, the novel follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of the ruling Party who begins to question the oppressive regime. Orwell's portrayal of a surveillance state, thought control, and the erasure of truth is eerily relevant in today's digital age. The novel introduces the concept of ""Newspeak,"" a language designed to eliminate independent thought. As Winston rebels against the system, he embarks on a dangerous journey for truth and freedom. The story is a harrowing exploration of the consequences of mass surveillance and authoritarianism. ""1984"" is not just a work of fiction; it's a warning about the dangers of sacrificing individual liberties for the illusion of security. It's a thought-provoking, unsettling, and thought-provoking read that remains profoundly relevant in our modern world. ABOUT THE AUTHOR George Orwell, the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair, was a renowned English writer and essayist. Born on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, India, he is best known for his literary contributions that challenged totalitarianism and explored the consequences of oppressive government systems. Orwell's early life included experiences as an imperial police officer in Burma, which profoundly influenced his views on British imperialism. His first notable work, ""Down and Out in Paris and London"", was published in 1933, recounting his experiences among the working class and homeless. However, it was Orwell's dystopian novels that catapulted him to literary fame. ""Animal Farm,"" published in 1945, is a satirical allegory that critiques the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism. In 1949, he released his magnum opus, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" which portrayed a nightmarish future under a totalitarian regime, coining terms like ""Big Brother"" and ""thoughtcrime"" that have become part of popular culture. Orwell's writing style is marked by its clarity and social commentary. He was a passionate advocate for truth and freedom of expression, which is evident in his essays like ""Politics and the English Language."" Sadly, Orwell's life was cut short by tuberculosis, and he passed away on January 21, 1950, at the age of 46. His works remain not only literary classics but also influential critiques of authoritarianism and the dangers of propaganda, ensuring his enduring legacy in the world of literature and political thought."	302	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=73j1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

50	The Odyssey	Homer	1997	"The great epic of Western literature, translated by the acclaimed classicist Robert Fagles Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Christopher Nolan A Penguin Classic Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning modern-verse translation. ""Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy."" So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in the New York Times Book Review hails as ""a distinguished achievement."" If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of an everyman's journey through life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide insightful background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles's translation. This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the general reader, to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.

Poised as one of the first novels to attract the American masses with its readable text style, Mark Twain wrote about the controversial subject matter regarding the unlikely friendship between a boy and a fugitive slave. After a life-changing adventure with his comrade, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, “Huck,” as he’s known, must figure out how to deal with his new life in the aftermath of finding a significant amount of money along the banks of the Mississippi River. Protecting what’s rightfully his, Huck keeps the money in a trust, tucked away from his drunken father.

Forced to endure confinement and relentless abuse, Huck takes matters into his own hands, leading him on the adventure, and a new friendship of a lifetime. Scared, lonely, and fiercely independent, Huck Finn must learn that in order to survive he must become comfortable with the uncomfortable. Huck must learn to trust those around him, and most importantly, to be brave in the face of extreme hardship.

63	Lolita	Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov	1958	"(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)When it was published in 1955, ""Lolita"" immediately became a cause célèbre because of the freedom and sophistication with which it handled the unusual erotic predilections of its protagonist. But Vladimir Nabokov's wise, ironic, elegant masterpiece owes its stature as one of the twentieth century's novels of record not to the controversy its material aroused but to its author's use of that material to tell a love story almost shocking in its beauty and tenderness. Awe and exhilaration-along with heartbreak and mordant wit-abound in this account of the aging Humbert Humbert's obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America, but most of all, it is a meditation on love-love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.With an Introduction by Martin Amis ""From the Hardcover edition."""	326	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M9JlAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

68	The Bell Jar	Sylvia Plath	2023	In Sylvia Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, The Bell Jar, readers are introduced to Esther Greenwood, a young woman grappling with the oppressive weight of societal expectations and her struggle with mental illness. The narrative unfolds with a poignant blend of dark humor and lyrical prose, allowing Plath to deftly explore themes of identity, feminism, and the unattainable ideals of perfection. Set against the backdrop of 1950s America, the novel captures the suffocating pressures placed on women while simultaneously offering a vivid portrait of mental anguish, all enveloped in a rich, confessional style that parallels Plath's own experiences and poetic sensibilities. Sylvia Plath, an emblematic figure of the confessional poetry movement, infused her writing with personal insight and emotional depth. Her own battles with depression and her turbulent life inevitably shaped the creation of The Bell Jar, illuminating the complexity of her characters and the authenticity of their voices. Plath's struggle to find her place in a male-dominated literary world further enhances the reading experience, inviting readers to reflect on the broader implications of her work in relation to mental health and gender. The Bell Jar is a must-read for anyone seeking a profound exploration of the human psyche. Plath's unflinching honesty and masterful command of language create a compelling narrative that resonates deeply, making it not just a story of one woman's descent into despair, but also a universal commentary on the pressures of conformity.

73	The Pillars of the Earth - Book 1 - Pillars of the Earth	Ken Follett	1989	"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known. Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes ""The Pillars of the Earth"" extraordinary is the time--the twelfth century; the place--feudal England; and the subject--the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters--into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life. The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king. At once a sensuous and endearing love story and an epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age, ""The Pillars of the Earth"" is without a doubt Ken Follett's masterpiece."		en

81	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest	Ken Kesey	1996	"""Powerful, poetic realism...makes the tired old subject of life in a mental hospital into an absorbing Orwellian microcosm of all humanity.""—Life. An international bestseller and the basis for a hugely successful film, Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was one of the defining works of the 1960s. This Viking Critical Library edition is accompanied by essays, discussion topics, a chronology, and a bibliography. A mordant, wickedly subversive parable set in a mental ward, the novel chronicles the head-on collision between its hell-raising, life-affirming hero Randle Patrick McMurphy and the totalitarian rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy swaggers into the mental ward like a blast of fresh air and turns the place upside down, starting a gambling operation, smuggling in wine and women, and egging on the other patients to join him in open rebellion. But McMurphy's revolution against Big Nurse and everything she stands for quickly turns from sport to a fierce power struggle with shattering results. With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Kesey created a work without precedent in American literature, a novel at once comic and tragic that probes the nature of madness and sanity, authority and vitality. Greeted by unanimous acclaim when it was first published, the book has become and enduring favorite of readers."	689	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=foRPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His opinion was shared by Vladimir Nabokov, who especially admired ""the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style,"" and by William Faulkner, who described the novel as ""the best ever written.""

84	The Brothers Karamazov	Fyodor Dostoevsky	2002	Winner of the Pen/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize The award-winning translation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's classic novel of psychological realism. The Brothers Karamazov is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of erotic rivalry in a series of triangular love affairs involving the “wicked and sentimental” Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov and his three sons—the impulsive and sensual Dmitri; the coldly rational Ivan; and the healthy, red-cheeked young novice Alyosha. Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture. This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky remains true to the verbal inventiveness of Dostoevsky’s prose, preserving the multiple voices, the humor, and the surprising modernity of the original. It is an achievement worthy of Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel.	826	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OG0e6djUgUYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion: ""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none."" When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

99	The Poisonwood Bible	Barbara Kingsolver	2009	New York Times Bestseller • Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize • An Oprah's Book Club Selection “Powerful . . . [Kingsolver] has with infinitely steady hands worked the prickly threads of religion, politics, race, sin and redemption into a thing of terrible beauty.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The Poisonwood Bible established Barbara Kingsolver, recipient of the National Book Foundation's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, it is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in Africa. The story is told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters—the teenaged Rachel; adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility.	578	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
100	The Old Man and the Sea	Ernest Hemingway	2020	Ernest Hemingway’s most beloved and popular novel ever, with millions of copies sold—now featuring early drafts and supplementary material as well as a personal foreword by the only living son of the author, Patrick Hemingway, and an introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway. The last novel Ernest Hemingway saw published, The Old Man and the Sea has proved itself to be one of the enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novel confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.	160	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NubsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

102	Atlas Shrugged	Ayn Rand	2005	Peopled by larger-than-life heroes and villains, charged with towering questions of good and evil, Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rand’s magnum opus: a philosophical revolution told in the form of an action thriller—nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read. Who is John Galt? When he says that he will stop the motor of the world, is he a destroyer or a liberator? Why does he have to fight his battles not against his enemies but against those who need him most? Why does he fight his hardest battle against the woman he loves? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the amazing men and women in this book. You will discover why a productive genius becomes a worthless playboy...why a great steel industrialist is working for his own destruction...why a composer gives up his career on the night of his triumph...why a beautiful woman who runs a transcontinental railroad falls in love with the man she has sworn to kill. Atlas Shrugged, a modern classic and Rand’s most extensive statement of Objectivism—her groundbreaking philosophy—offers the reader the spectacle of human greatness, depicted with all the poetry and power of one of the twentieth century’s leading artists.	1121	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bVyCd7da8OcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

105	Fahrenheit 451 Ray Bradbury	Ray Bradbury	2020	"Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper spontaneously catches fire and burns. It is a futuristic novel describing a time when the government has ordered that all books be burned. This may seem to be ridiculous and could never be happening, but it is starting to happen in real life now, today. Now we have a president who accuses everything in the press of being ""fake news"". He tells his followers who constitute a near majority never to believe the news media. He has ordered the arrest and criminal prosecution of the leading law enforcement officers including the Director of the FBI and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He has accused most of his political opponents of corruption and crime. Nobody knows what is the truth and what is false any more. He says that decisions of the highest courts of the United States are almost all fake. He openly attacks and criticizes the highest judges of the Supreme Court. He says the truth is false and the false is true. The result is we the people do not know who or what to believe. All the great scientists have found that climate change is real and our time on this earth may be limited, but he says climate change is a hoax and we should ignore the works of the scientists. This is not the first time this has happened. In China, Chairman Mao declared his Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forwards. China has the oldest civilization in the world, going back to before Confucius in 551-479 BC. Yet, during the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao ordered all the old books burned and destroyed and even ordered the people to destroy their old household furniture. I found this out myself in 2011 when I toured China after the World Memory Championships in Guangzhou China. As a book publisher, I wanted to reprint some old classical works. I was shocked to discover that no books were available dated before 1949 and few after that. Everything earlier than that had been destroyed. I am still hoping that some older Chinese books have been preserved in Taiwan. I consider a book dated 1949 to be a relatively new book. I usually do not bother with such recent books. The destruction of all books in China dated before 1949 is not reported on any website that I have found but I saw with my own eyes that all such books were gone."	216	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UGVrzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
106	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince	J.K. Rowling	2015	There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building... wherever they had murdered... When Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive one summer night to collect Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened and shrivelled, but he does not reveal why. Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the wizarding world, and Hogwarts itself is not safe. Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: there is a Death Eater amongst them. Harry will need powerful magic and true friends as he explores Voldemort's darkest secrets, and Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny... Having become classics of our time, the Harry Potter eBooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism. With their message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived continues to delight generations of new readers.	661	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R7YsowJI9-IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
107	Moby-Dick	Herman Melville	2002	Herman Melville’s masterpiece of obsession and the untamed sea, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history—featuring an introduction by Andrew Delbanco and notes by Tom Quirk. This edition features the Northwestern-Newberry edition of Melville's text, approved by the Center for Scholarly Editions and the Center for Editions of American Authors of the MLA. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read Moby-Dick still stands as an indisputable literary classic. It is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, Moby-Dick is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception. Penguin Classics is the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world, representing a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

108	A Prayer for Owen Meany	John Irving	2012	“I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice—not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother’s death, but because he was the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany.” In the summer of 1953, two eleven-year-old boys—best friends—are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy’s mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn’t believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God’s instrument. What happens to Owen, after that 1953 foul ball, is extraordinary and terrifying.	658	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pcCpqpWPKrkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

With an Introduction by Peter Dunwoodie; translated by Matthew Ward. Behind the subterfuge, Camus explores what he termed ""the nakedness of man faced with the absurd"" and describes the condition of reckless alienation and spiritual exhaustion that characterized so much of twentieth-century life. “The Stranger is a strikingly modern text and Matthew Ward’s translation will enable readers to appreciate why Camus’s stoical anti-hero and ­devious narrator remains one of the key expressions of a postwar Western malaise, and one of the cleverest exponents of a literature of ambiguity.” —from the Introduction by Peter Dunwoodie First published in 1946; now in translation by Matthew Ward."	134	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7qylv1KYf0kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

112	The Red Tent - 20th Anniversary Edition	Anita Diamant	2010	In this modern classic interpretation of the biblical story of Dinah, Anita Diamant imagines the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood--the world of The Red Tent, a New York Times bestseller and the basis of the A&E/Lifetime mini-series. Twentieth Anniversary Edition In the Bible, Dinah's life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that tell of her father, Jacob, and his twelve sons. The Red Tent begins with the story of the mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through childhood, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting, The Red Tent combines rich storytelling and the valuable achievement of presenting a new view of biblical women's lives.	266	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5hcdO0pDtY8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

117	The Hobbit Illustrated by the Author	J. R. R. Tolkien	2023	For the first time ever, a special enhanced edition of the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings, illustrated throughout with over 50 sketches, drawings, paintings and maps by J.R.R. Tolkien himself. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey ‘there and back again.’ They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon . . . Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit was published on 21 September 1937. With a beautiful cover design, a handful of black & white drawings and two maps by the author himself, the book became an instant success and was reprinted shortly afterwards with five color plates. Tolkien’s own selection of finished paintings and drawings have become inseparable from his text, adorning editions of The Hobbit for more than 85 years. But the published art has afforded only a glimpse of Tolkien’s creative process, and many additional sketches, colored drawings and maps – although exhibited and published elsewhere – have never appeared within the pages of The Hobbit. In this unique enhanced edition of Tolkien’s enchanting classic tale, the full panoply of his art is reproduced for the first time, presenting more than 50 illustrations to accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventure ‘there and back again.’	396	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Fse0EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

126	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon	2009	A bestselling modern classic—both poignant and funny—narrated by a fifteen year old autistic savant obsessed with Sherlock Holmes, this dazzling novel weaves together an old-fashioned mystery, a contemporary coming-of-age story, and a fascinating excursion into a mind incapable of processing emotions. Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. At fifteen, Christopher’s carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbour’s dog Wellington impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer, and turns to his favourite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents’ marriage. As Christopher tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, the narrative draws readers into the workings of Christopher’s mind. And herein lies the key to the brilliance of Mark Haddon’s choice of narrator: The most wrenching of emotional moments are chronicled by a boy who cannot fathom emotions. The effect is dazzling, making for one of the freshest debut in years: a comedy, a tearjerker, a mystery story, a novel of exceptional literary merit that is great fun to read.	182	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Thc32eB1Kx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

To this library, a man brings his 10-year-old son Daniel one cold morning in 1945. Daniel is allowed to choose one book from the shelves and pulls out 'La Sombra del Viento' by Julian Carax. But as he grows up, several people seem inordinately interested in his find. Then, one night, as he is wandering the old streets once more, Daniel is approached by a figure who reminds him of a character from La Sombra del Viento, a character who turns out to be the devil. This man is tracking down every last copy of Carax's work in order to burn them. What begins as a case of literary curiosity turns into a race to find out the truth behind the life and death of Julian Carax and to save those he left behind. A page-turning exploration of obsession in literature and love, and the places that obsession can lead.	403	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuywcQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

129	Tuesdays with Morrie	Mitch Albom	2006	"Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago. Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger? Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final ""class"": lessons in how to live. ""Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.

130	The Unbearable Lightness of Being	Milan Kundera	2004	"When The Unbearable Lightness of Being was first published in English, it was hailed as ""a work of the boldest mastery, originality, and richness"" by critic Elizabeth Hardwick and named one of the best books of 1984 by the New York Times Book Review. It went on to win the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction and quickly became an international bestseller. Twenty years later, the novel has established itself as a modern classic. To commemorate the anniversary of its first English-language publication, HarperCollins is proud to offer a special hardcover edition. A young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover -- these are the two couples whose story is told in this masterful novel. Controlled by day, Tereza's jealousy awakens by night, transformed into ineffably sad death-dreams, while Tomas, a successful surgeon, alternates loving devotion to the dependent Tereza with the ardent pursuit of other women. Sabina, an independent, free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals -- of parents, husband, country, love itself -- whereas her lover, the intellectual Franz, loses all because of his earnest goodness and fidelity. In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel, says the novelist, ""the unbearable lightness of being"" -- not only as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine. This magnificent novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence. It juxtaposes geographically distant places (Prague, Geneva, Paris, Thailand, the United States, a forlorn Bohemian village); brilliant and playful reflections (on ""eternal return,"" on kitsch, on man and animals -- Tomas and Tereza have a beloved doe named Karenin); and a variety of styles (from the farcical to the elegiac) to take its place as perhaps the major achievement of one of the world's truly great writers."	324	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7QpErH6s8hcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
131	On the Road: The Original Scroll	Jack Kerouac	2007	The legendary 1951 scroll draft of On the Road, published word for word as Kerouac originally composed it Though Jack Kerouac began thinking about the novel that was to become On the Road as early as 1947, it was not until three weeks in April 1951, in an apartment on West Twentieth Street in Manhattan, that he wrote the first full draft that was satisfactory to him. Typed out as one long, single-spaced paragraph on eight long sheets of tracing paper that he later taped together to form a 120 foot scroll, this document is among the most significant, celebrated, and provocative artifacts in contemporary American literary history. It represents the first full expression of Kerouac’s revolutionary aesthetic, the identifiable point at which his thematic vision and narrative voice came together in a sustained burst of creative energy. It was also part of a wider vital experimentation in the American literary, musical, and visual arts in the post-World War II period. It was not until more than six years later, and several new drafts, that Viking published, in 1957, the novel known to us today. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of On the Road, Viking will publish the 1951 scroll in a standard book format. The differences between the two versions are principally ones of significant detail and altered emphasis. The scroll is slightly longer and has a heightened linguistic virtuosity and a more sexually frenetic tone. It also uses the real names of Kerouac’s friends instead of the fictional names he later invented for them. The transcription of the scroll was done by Howard Cunnell who, along with Joshua Kupetz, George Mouratidis, and Penny Vlagopoulos, provides a critical introduction that explains the fascinating compositional and publication history of On the Road and anchors the text in its historical, political, and social context.	424	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jr5jsdYci2EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

136	In Cold Blood	Truman Capote	2013	Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time From the Modern Library’s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by Truman Capote—also available are Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Other Voices, Other Rooms (in one volume), Portraits and Observations, and The Complete Stories Truman Capote’s masterpiece, In Cold Blood, created a sensation when it was first published, serially, in The New Yorker in 1965. The intensively researched, atmospheric narrative of the lives of the Clutter family of Holcomb, Kansas, and of the two men, Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, who brutally killed them on the night of November 15, 1959, is the seminal work of the “new journalism.” Perry Smith is one of the great dark characters of American literature, full of contradictory emotions. “I thought he was a very nice gentleman,” he says of Herb Clutter. “Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.” Told in chapters that alternate between the Clutter household and the approach of Smith and Hickock in their black Chevrolet, then between the investigation of the case and the killers’ flight, Capote’s account is so detailed that the reader comes to feel almost like a participant in the events.	417	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TH5uM_f0MRwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

145	A Story of Yesterday	Sergio Cobo					
146	All Quiet on the Western Front	Erich Maria Remarque	2025	"""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Maria Remarque is a powerful and poignant novel that explores the harrowing experiences of soldiers during World War I. First published in 1929, the book is narrated by Paul Bäumer, a young German soldier who enlists in the army with his classmates, driven by a sense of patriotism and idealism. However, as the story unfolds, Paul and his friends quickly come to face the brutal realities of war, which shatter their youthful illusions. The novel provides a firsthand account of the horrors of trench warfare. Through Paul's eyes, readers witness the physical and emotional toll that war takes on soldiers. The graphic descriptions of battles, injuries, and death serve to highlight the senselessness of conflict and the loss of human life. Remarque's writing captures the chaos and fear that permeate the battlefield, immersing readers in the intense atmosphere of war. One of the central themes of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is the disillusionment experienced by soldiers. As Paul and his comrades endure relentless suffering, they begin to question the values and beliefs that led them to enlist. The camaraderie among the soldiers becomes a vital source of support, as they navigate the challenges of survival together. However, the novel also illustrates how war ultimately alienates them from their former lives and identities. Paul struggles to reconcile his experiences with the expectations of society, feeling increasingly disconnected from the world he once knew. The impact of war on mental health is another significant aspect of the novel. Remarque portrays the psychological scars that soldiers carry long after the fighting has ceased. Paul grapples with feelings of despair, hopelessness, and trauma, reflecting the broader struggles faced by veterans. The novel emphasizes that the effects of war extend beyond the battlefield, haunting those who survive and shaping their futures in profound ways. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" also critiques the romanticism often associated with war. Through Paul's journey, Remarque challenges the glorified notions of heroism and sacrifice, revealing the grim reality of combat. The novel serves as a powerful anti-war statement, urging readers to confront the true nature of conflict and its devastating consequences. Remarque's poignant prose and vivid imagery compel readers to empathize with the soldiers' plight, fostering a deeper understanding of the human cost of war. In addition to its exploration of the soldier's experience, the novel delves into the broader societal implications of war. Remarque critiques the political and military leaders who send young men to fight, often without a true understanding of the consequences. The indifference of those in power is juxtaposed with the suffering of the soldiers, highlighting the disconnect between the ruling class and the realities faced by those on the front lines. The novel's impact has endured over the decades, resonating with readers across generations. It has been translated into numerous languages and adapted into various films and stage productions, further solidifying its place in literary history. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" remains a vital work that speaks to the universal themes of loss, trauma, and the search for meaning in the face of adversity. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Maria Remarque is a profound and moving exploration of the experiences of soldiers during World War I. Through the eyes of Paul Bäumer, readers are confronted with the harsh realities of war, the disillusionment that follows, and the lasting impact on mental health. The novel serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for empathy and understanding in times of war. Its enduring relevance and emotional depth make it a must-read for anyone seeking to comprehend the complexities of the human experience in the face of violence and suffering."	177	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cedBEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Denslow, originally published by the George M. Hill Company in Chicago on May 17, 1900. It has since been reprinted on numerous occasions, most often under the title The Wizard of Oz, which is the title of the popular 1902 Broadway musical as well as the iconic 1939 musical film adaptation. The story chronicles the adventures of a young farm girl named Dorothy in the magical Land of Oz, after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their Kansas home by a cyclone.[nb 1] The novel is one of the best-known stories in American literature and has been widely translated. The Library of Congress has declared it ""America's greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale."" Its groundbreaking success and the success of the Broadway musical adapted from the novel led Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books that serve as official sequels to the first story. Baum dedicated the book ""to my good friend & comrade, My Wife,"" Maud Gage Baum. In January 1901, George M. Hill Company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000 copies, which quickly sold out.

On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis sees her sister Cecilia strip off her clothes and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching her is Robbie Turner, son of the Tallis’s cleaning lady, whose education has been subsidized by Cecilia’s and Briony’s father, and who, like Cecilia, has recently come down from Cambridge. By day's end, their lives will be changed – irrevocably. Robbie and Cecilia will have crossed a boundary they had not imagined at its start. And Briony will have witnessed mysteries, seen an unspeakable word, and committed a crime for which she will spend the rest of her life trying to atone… Brilliant and utterly enthralling in its depiction of love and war and class and childhood and England, An Atonement is a profound – and profoundly moving – exploration of shame and forgiveness, of atonement and of the possibility of absolution.	416	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NKasHN-C2_4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. “Heartbreaking, yet beautiful” (Jamie Blynn, Us Weekly), The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is “Tinseltown drama at its finest” (Redbook): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it costs—to face the truth.	403	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=njVpDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

234	The Trial	Franz Kafka	2018	"""The Trial"" (original German title: ""Der Process"", later ""Der Prozess"", ""Der Proceß"" and ""Der Prozeß"") is a novel written by Franz Kafka in 1914 and 1915 but not published until 1925. One of Kafka's best-known works, it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor the reader. Like Kafka's other novels, ""The Trial"" was never completed, although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end. Because of this, there are some inconsistencies and discontinuities in narration within the novel, such as disparities in timing. After Kafka's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede. The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany. In 1999, the book was listed in ""Le Monde""'s 100 Books of the Century and as No. 2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century."	243	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i0FqEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

240	The Sun Also Rises	Ernest Hemingway	2022	A Contemporary Classics hardcover edition of Nobel Prize–winner Ernest Hemingway’s landmark first novel—both a tragic love story and a searing group portrait of hapless American expatriates drinking, dancing, and chasing their illusions in post–World War I Europe. The Sun Also Rises tracks the Lost Generation of the 1920s from the nightclubs of Paris to the bullfighting arenas of Spain. The man at its center, world-weary journalist Jake Barnes, is burdened both by a wound acquired in the war and by his utterly hopeless love for the extravagantly decadent Lady Brett Ashley. When Jake, Brett, and their friends leave Paris behind and converge in Pamplona for the annual festival of the running of the bulls, tensions among the various rivals for Brett’s wayward affections build to a devastating climax. Ernest Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954, has exerted a lasting influence on fiction in English. His signature prose style, tersely powerful and concealing more than it reveals, arguably reached its apex in this modernist masterpiece. “His lean, terse style is one of the monumental achievements of twentieth-century prose.... Hemingway modeled a way to build sentences and paragraphs that vibrated with emotion.... In The Sun Also Rises he achieved an imaginative insight into his own illusions and disillusions that goes beyond the surfaces of the Jazz Age to the welter of feelings wrapped up in being lost.” —from the Introduction by Nicholas Gaskill Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket.	281	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RU1uEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
241	Man's Search for Meaning	Viktor E. Frankl	2014	The bestselling Holocaust memoir about finding purpose and strength in times of despair—selected as a Library of Congress “10 Most Influential Books in America” This stunning gift edition of “one of the great books of our time” (Harold S. Kushner) features new photos, end papers, and Frankl’s never-before-published speeches and letters. Hailed as “an enduring work of survival literature” by the New York Times, Viktor Frankl’s account of his time in the Nazi concentration camps—and his insights into our ability to find meaning despite great adversity—has offered solace and guidance to generations of readers since it was first published in 1946. This stunning hardcover gift edition features previously unpublished material—including letters, speeches, essays, and an 8-page photo insert—that reveal Frankl’s enduring lessons on perseverance and strength in even greater depth. At the heart of Frankl’s theory of logotherapy (from the Greek word for “meaning”) is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but rather the discovery and pursuit of what the individual finds meaningful. Today, as new generations face new challenges and an ever more complex and uncertain world, Frankl’s classic work continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living, in spite of all obstacles. With more than 16 million copies sold in over 50 languages, this timeless masterpiece is “one of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought” (Carl Rogers) and offers inspiration for coping with suffering and finding your purpose.	202	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RMqMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

243	Howl's Moving Castle	Diana Wynne Jones	1986	In the land of Ingary, such things as spells, invisible cloaks, and seven-league boots were everyday things. The Witch of the Waste was another matter. After fifty years of quiet, it was rumored that the Witch was about to terrorize the country again. So when a moving black castle, blowing dark smoke from its four thin turrets, appeared on the horizon, everyone thought it was the Witch. The castle, however, belonged to Wizard Howl, who, it was said, liked to suck the souls of young girls. The Hatter sisters--Sophie, Lettie, and Martha--and all the other girls were warned not to venture into the streets alone. But that was only the beginning. In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl's castle? Diana Wynne Jones's entrancing fantasy is filled with surprises at every turn, but when the final stormy duel between the Witch and the Wizard is finished, all the pieces fall magically into place.	340	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Omgre9A-fKkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
244	The Secret Magdalene	Ki Longfellow	2007	Raised like sisters, Mariamne and Salome are indulged with riches, position, and learning-a rare thing for females in Jerusalem. But Mariamne has a further gift: an illness has left her with visions; she has the power of prophecy. It is her prophesying that drives the two girls to flee to Egypt, where they study philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy in the Great Library of Alexandria. After seven years they return to a Judaea where many now believe John the Baptizer is the messiah. Salome too begins to believe, but Mariamne, now called Magdalene, is drawn to his cousin, Yeshu’a, a man touched by the divine in the same way she was during her days of illness. Together they speak of sharing their direct experience of God; but Yeshu’a unexpectedly gains a reputation as a healer, and as the ill and the troubled flock to him, he and Magdalene are forced to make a terrible decision. This radical retelling of the greatest story ever told brings Mary Magdalene to life-not as a prostitute or demon-possessed-but as an educated woman who was truly the “apostle to the apostles.”	450	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AmNFde3V7RMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
245	The Crucible	Arthur Miller	2003	"A haunting examination of groupthink and mass hysteria in a rural community The place is Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, an enclave of rigid piety huddled on the edge of a wilderness. Its inhabitants believe unquestioningly in their own sanctity. But in Arthur Miller's edgy masterpiece, that very belief will have poisonous consequences when a vengeful teenager accuses a rival of witchcraft—and then when those accusations multiply to consume the entire village. First produced in 1953, at a time when America was convulsed by a new epidemic of witch-hunting, The Crucible brilliantly explores the threshold between individual guilt and mass hysteria, personal spite and collective evil. It is a play that is not only relentlessly suspenseful and vastly moving but that compels readers to fathom their hearts and consciences in ways that only the greatest theater ever can.

248	The Screwtape Letters	C. S. Lewis	2023	"""The Screwtape Letters"" by C.S. Lewis is a thought-provoking and satirical work that takes the form of a series of letters from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, who is a junior tempter. Through these letters, Screwtape provides guidance on the art of tempting and leading humans away from virtue and into the clutches of Hell. As the letters unfold, readers gain insight into the subtle tactics used by demons to exploit human weaknesses, distract them from spiritual growth, and undermine their moral compass. Lewis skillfully weaves together humor and profound observations to explore the complexities of human nature, the dynamics of good and evil, and the eternal struggle for the soul. ""The Screwtape Letters"" is a timeless exploration of morality, temptation, and the battle between good and evil. Lewis's unique narrative approach offers readers a fresh perspective on the spiritual journey, encouraging introspection and contemplation of the human condition. This classic work continues to resonate with audiences, challenging them to reflect on their own beliefs and choices in the ongoing quest for moral and spiritual understanding."	106	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vkroEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

253	The God of Small Things	Arundhati Roy	2008	BOOKER PRIZE WINNER • NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • An affluent Indian family is forever changed by one fateful day in 1969, from the author of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness “[The God of Small Things] offers such magic, mystery, and sadness that, literally, this reader turned the last page and decided to reread it.

Lush, lyrical, and unnerving, The God of Small Things is an award-winning landmark that started for its author an esteemed career of fiction and political commentary that continues unabated.	411	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nwICBETtEqYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The triumphant true story of one courageous Christian woman who became a militant heroine of the anti-Nazi underground. “I pray that God forgive them...” Corrie Ten Boom stood naked with her older sister Betsie, watching a concentration camp matron beating a prisoner. “Oh, the poor woman,” Corrie cried. “Yes.

A story of Christ’s message and the courage woman who listened and lived to pass it along—with joy and triumph!	276	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bAdGjSPajlIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and raping women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides seven strangers--among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears--through the barren streets, and the procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. A magnificent parable of loss and disorientation and a vivid evocation of the horrors of the twentieth century, Blindness has swept the reading public with its powerful portrayal of man's worst appetites and weaknesses--and man's ultimately exhilarating spirit."	318	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ab5g1_ghuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

264	The House of the Spirits	Isabel Allende	2005	Chilean writer Isabel Allende’s classic novel is both a richly symbolic family saga and the riveting story of an unnamed Latin American country’s turbulent history. In a triumph of magic realism, Allende constructs a spirit-ridden world and fills it with colorful and all-too-human inhabitants. The Trueba family’s passions, struggles, and secrets span three generations and a century of violent social change, culminating in a crisis that brings the proud and tyrannical patriarch and his beloved granddaughter to opposite sides of the barricades. Against a backdrop of revolution and counterrevolution, Allende brings to life a family whose private bonds of love and hatred are more complex and enduring than the political allegiances that set them at odds. The House of the Spirits not only brings another nation’s history thrillingly to life, but also makes its people’s joys and anguishes wholly our own.	522	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wSlhlpIMXc0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

266	The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society	Mary Ann Shaffer, Annie Barrows	2008	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NOW A NETFLIX FILM • A remarkable tale of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation, and of a society as extraordinary as its name. “Treat yourself to this book, please—I can’t recommend it highly enough.”—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love “I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb. . . . As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways. Praise for The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society “A jewel . . . Poignant and keenly observed, Guernsey is a small masterpiece about love, war, and the immeasurable sustenance to be found in good books and good friends.”—People “A book-lover’s delight, an implicit and sometimes explicit paean to all things literary.”—Chicago Sun-Times “A sparkling epistolary novel radiating wit, lightly worn erudition and written with great assurance and aplomb.”—The Sunday Times (London) “Cooked perfectly à point: subtle and elegant in flavour, yet emotionally satisfying to the finish.”—The Times (London)	290	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d0qNDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The next, she's Marked as a fledgling vampyre, forcing her to leave her ordinary life behind and join the House of Night, a boarding school where she will train to become an adult vampyre. That is, if she makes it through the Change--and not all of those who are Marked do. It sucks to begin a new life, especially away from her friends, and on top of that, Zoey is no average fledgling. She has been chosen as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx. Zoey discovers she has amazing powers, but along with her powers come bloodlust and an unfortunate ability to Imprint with Heath, who just doesn't know how to take ""no"" for an answer. To add to her stress, she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers: when she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends."	320	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mnBAPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

But it's the rest of the family who must deal with the fallout. There are Caddy's three brothers: manchild Benjy, neurotic and conservative Quentin, and ruthless and cynical Jason. Meanwhile, Dilsey, the family's Black servant, keeps house. Together, these four bear witness as the Compson family ties begin to unravel . . . Originally published in 1929, The Sound and the Fury is William Faulkner's fourth novel. Although it was not an immediate success, it has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, as well as Faulkner's masterpiece."	258	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Ms6EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Petersburg the prince finds himself a stranger in a society obsessed with money, power, and manipulation.

286	Into the Wild	Jon Krakauer	2009	"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. This is the unforgettable story of how Christopher Johnson McCandless came to die. ""It may be nonfiction, but Into the Wild is a mystery of the highest order."" —Entertainment Weekly McCandess had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Not long after, he was dead. Into the Wild is the mesmerizing, heartbreaking tale of an enigmatic young man who goes missing in the wild and whose story captured the world’s attention. Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interest that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the drives and desires that propelled McCandless. When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding—and not an ounce of sentimentality. Into the Wild is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page."	241	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=waBwNtI6rSwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

292	The Things They Carried	Tim O'Brien	1990	"One of the first questions people ask about The Things They Carried is this: Is it a novel, or a collection of short stories? The title page refers to the book simply as ""a work of fiction,"" defying the conscientious reader's need to categorize this masterpiece. It is both: a collection of interrelated short pieces which ultimately reads with the dramatic force and tension of a novel. Yet each one of the twenty-two short pieces is written with such care, emotional content, and prosaic precision that it could stand on its own. The Things They Carried depicts the men of Alpha Company: Jimmy Cross, Henry Dobbins, Rat Kiley, Mitchell Sanders, Norman Bowker, Kiowa, and of course, the character Tim O'Brien who has survived his tour in Vietnam to become a father and writer at the age of forty-three. They battle the enemy (or maybe more the idea of the enemy), and occasionally each other. In their relationships we see their isolation and loneliness, their rage and fear. They miss their families, their girlfriends and buddies; they miss the lives they left back home. Yet they find sympathy and kindness for strangers (the old man who leads them unscathed through the mine field, the girl who grieves while she dances), and love for each other, because in Vietnam they are the only family they have. We hear the voices of the men and build images upon their dialogue. The way they tell stories about others, we hear them telling stories about themselves. With the creative verve of the greatest fiction and the intimacy of a searing autobiography, The Things They Carried is a testament to the men who risked their lives in America's most controversial war.It is also a mirror held up to the frailty of humanity. Ultimately The Things They Carried and its myriad protagonists call to order the courage, determination, and luck we all need to survive. In 1979, Tim O'Brien's Going After Cacciato -- a novel about the Vietnam War -- won the National Book Award. In this, his second work of fiction about Vietnam, O'Brien's unique artistic vision is again clearly demonstrated. Neither a novel nor a short story collection, it is an arc of fictional episodes, taking place in the childhoods of its characters, in the jungles of Vietnam and back home in America two decades later."	296	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ElfhAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

297	Blood River	Tim Butcher	2007	Ever since Stanley first charted its mighty river in the 1870s, the Congo has epitomized the dark and turbulent history of a failed continent. However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley’s original expedition — but travelling alone. Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo’s eastern border. He passed through once thriving cities of this country and saw the marks left behind by years of abuse and misrule. Almost, 2,500 harrowing miles later, he reached the Atlantic Ocean, a thinner and a wiser man. Butcher’s journey was a remarkable feat. But the story of the Congo, vividly told in Blood River, is more remarkable still.	392	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0Ao_AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

300	Twilight: Midnight Sunburn	Anna Jones Buttimore	2016	"Twilight has enthralled millions of readers around the globe, but Stephenie Meyer never completed Midnight Sun, the story told from Edward's perspective. Midnight Sunburn is a light and reverent parody of that long-anticipated book. It gives a glimpse into what Midnight Sun might have been, with added gentle satire and wry humour. Midnight Sunburn shows the unfolding of Edward's fierce love for the mysteriously closed Bella Swan, explains how he overcomes his thirst for her blood, and reveals why he would rather watch her die than transform her into a vampire. It also divulges what Edward uses to paint on his abs, explains why he can't use smartphones, and gives the reader a glimpse of Carlisle and Esme in Wal-Mart. Reviews for a previous version of Midnight Sunburn:""I just needed closure. This book provided it delightfully.""""This is exactly what I've been craving as a fan. It's just spectacular.""""Surprisingly good book. Really good job.""""Wow!

305	I Know This Much Is True	Wally Lamb	1998	"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched."	884	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gXk5wYNESPsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
306	Flow Down Like Silver	Ki Longfellow	2009	Ki Longfellow, author of the acclaimed The Secret Magdalene, has now written the astonishing life of Hypatia, famed throughout the Mediterranean world, a beauty and a genius, yet for 17 centuries ignored by history. As the Roman Empire fights for its life and emerging Christianity fights for our souls, Hypatia is the last great voice of reason. A woman of sublime intelligence, Hypatia ranks above not only all women, but all men. Hypatia dazzled the world with her brilliance, was courted by men of every persuasion and was considered the leading philosopher and mathematician of her age...yet her mathematics, her inventions, the very story of her life in all its epic and dramatic intensity, has gone untold. A heart-breaking love story, an heroic struggle against intolerance, a tragedy and a triumph, Hypatia walks through these pages fully realized while all around her Egypt's Alexandria, the New York City of its day, strives to remain a beacon of light in a darkening world.	310	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v4-QQAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

309	The Historian	Elizabeth Kostova	2005	"The record-breaking phenomenon from Elizabeth Kostova is a celebrated masterpiece that ""refashioned the vampire myth into a compelling contemporary novel, a late-night page-turner"" (San Francisco Chronicle). Breathtakingly suspenseful and beautifully written, The Historian is the story of a young woman plunged into a labyrinth where the secrets of her family’s past connect to an inconceivable evil: the dark fifteenth-century reign of Vlad the Impaler and a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive through the ages. The search for the truth becomes an adventure of monumental proportions, taking us from monasteries and dusty libraries to the capitals of Eastern Europe—in a feat of storytelling so rich, so hypnotic, so exciting that it has enthralled readers around the world. “Part thriller, part history, part romance...Kostova has a keen sense of storytelling and she has a marvelous tale to tell.” —Baltimore Sun"	660	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qq_H8Td10AAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
310	Wonder	R. J. Palacio	2012	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Millions of people have fallen in love with Auggie Pullman, an ordinary boy with an extraordinary face—who shows us that kindness brings us together no matter how far apart we are. Read the book that inspired the Choose Kind movement, a major motion picture, and the critically acclaimed graphic novel White Bird. And don't miss R.J. Palacio's highly anticipated new novel, Pony, available now! I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. Beginning from Auggie’s point of view and expanding to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others, the perspectives converge to form a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel “a meditation on kindness” —indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.	322	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZJuLKKpvOBYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
311	Candide	Voltaire	2009	The philosophical problem of evil—that a supposedly good God could allow terrible human suffering—troubled the minds of eighteenth-century thinkers as it troubles us today. Voltaire’s classic novel Candide relates the misadventures of a young optimist who leaves his sheltered childhood to find his way in a cruel and irrational world. Fast-paced and full of dark humor, the novel mocks the suggestion that “all is well” and challenges us to create a better world. This Broadview Edition follows the text of a 1759 English translation that was released concurrently with Voltaire’s first French edition. Candide is supplemented by Voltaire’s most important poetic and humanistic writings on God and evil, the Poem upon the Destruction of Lisbon and We Must Take Sides. The editor’s introduction situates the novel in its philosophical and intellectual setting; the appendices include other writings by Voltaire, as well as related writings by Bayle, Leibniz, Pope, Rousseau, and others that place the work in its poetic, philosophical, and humanistic contexts.	258	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1A0WO7Od0HAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
312	The Time Machine	H. G. Wells	2016	'So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers...' At a Victorian dinner party, in Richmond, London, the Time Traveller returns to tell his extraordinary tale of mankind's future in the year 802,701 AD. It is a dystopian vision of Darwinian evolution, with humans split into an above-ground species of Eloi, and their troglodyte brothers. The first book H. G. Wells published, The Time Machine is a scientific romance that helped invent the genre of science fiction and the time travel story. Even before its serialisation had finished in the spring of 1895, Wells had been declared 'a man of genius', and the book heralded a fifty year career of a major cultural and political controversialist. It is a sardonic rejection of Victorian ideals of progress and improvement and a detailed satirical commentary on the Decadent culture of the 1890s. This edition features a contextual introduction, detailed explanatory notes, and two essays Wells wrote just prior to the publication of his first book.	161	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IMHXDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

His brain-fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight. Somehow Percy managed to make it to the camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he had to continually kill monsters that, annoyingly, would not stay dead. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. Hazel is supposed to be dead. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. When the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her ""gift"" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now, because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Frank is a klutz. His grandmother claims he is descended from ancient heroes, but he doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery. His big and bulky physique makes him feel like a clumsy ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely-enough, even, to share the secret he holds close to his heart. Beginning at the ""other"" camp for half-bloods and extending as far north as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment in the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all of whom are destined to play a part in the most important quest of all: the Prophecy of Seven.

330	Walden	Henry David Thoreau	2025	Walden is a profound reflection on simplicity, self-reliance, and the relationship between humanity and nature, set against the backdrop of a secluded life by Walden Pond. Henry David Thoreau critiques the materialism and societal conventions of 19th-century America, advocating for a life of deliberate purpose and harmony with the natural world. Through his personal experiment in minimalist living, Thoreau explores themes of solitude, introspection, and the pursuit of higher truths. Since its publication, Walden has been celebrated for its lyrical prose and philosophical depth. Its examination of universal themes such as the search for meaning, the value of self-determination, and the importance of living authentically has solidified its place as a cornerstone of American literature. Thoreau's vivid descriptions of nature and his contemplative observations continue to inspire readers to question modern life's pace and priorities. The work's enduring relevance lies in its challenge to societal norms and its invitation to reimagine what it means to lead a fulfilling life. By addressing the intersections of personal freedom, environmental stewardship, and spiritual growth, Walden encourages readers to reflect on their connections to both the natural world and their inner selves, offering timeless insights into the art of living deliberately	367	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=djQ_EQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

333	The Martian	Andy Weir	2014	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Brilliant . . . a celebration of human ingenuity [and] the purest example of real-science sci-fi for many years . . . utterly compelling.”—The Wall Street Journal The inspiration for the major motion picture Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him? NAMED ONE OF PASTE’S BEST NOVELS OF THE DECADE “A hugely entertaining novel [that] reads like a rocket ship afire . . . Weir has fashioned in Mark Watney one of the most appealing, funny, and resourceful characters in recent fiction.”—Chicago Tribune “As gripping as they come . . .

It was his way, he said, of ""getting my mental arm in shape to pitch a good game."" Steinbeck's letters were written on the left-hand pages of a notebook in which the facing pages would be filled with the test of East of Eden. They touched on many subjects—story arguments, trial flights of workmanship, concern for his sons. Part autobiography, part writer's workshop, these letters offer an illuminating perspective on Steinbeck's creative process, and a fascinating glimpse of Steinbeck, the private man."	192	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kqa-LNTu_TkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

With unmatched suspense and her signature cinematic storytelling, #1 New York Times–bestselling author Marie Lu plunges readers back into the unforgettable world of Legend for a truly grand finale. Eden Wing has been living in his brother’s shadow for years. Even though he’s a top student at his academy in Ross City, Antarctica, and a brilliant inventor, most people know him only as Daniel Wing’s little brother. A decade ago, Daniel was known as Day, the boy from the streets who led a revolution that saved the Republic of America. But Day is no longer the same young man who was once a national hero. These days he’d rather hide out from the world and leave his past behind. All that matters to him now is keeping Eden safe—even if that also means giving up June, the great love of Daniel’s life.

338	The Hound of the Baskervilles (Sherlock Holmes #5)	Arthur Conan Doyle	2020	"The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the crime novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. Dr. James Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes for advice following the death of his friend, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles was found dead on the grounds of his Devonshire estate, Baskerville Hall. Mortimer now fears for Sir Charles's nephew and sole heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, who is the new master of Baskerville Hall. The death was attributed to a heart attack, but Mortimer is suspicious, because Sir Charles died with an expression of horror on his face, and Mortimer noticed ""the footprints of a gigantic hound"" about 50 yards from where Sir Charles lay dead. The Baskerville family has supposedly been under a curse since the era of the English Civil War when ancestor Hugo Baskerville allegedly offered his soul to the devil for help in abducting a woman and was reportedly killed by a giant spectral hound. Sir Charles believed in the curse and was apparently fleeing from something in fright when he died.The primary mystery involves the death of Sir Charles Baskerville at his estate in the beautiful countryside of Devon, but interestingly, the author also includes a number of mini-mysteries which I found engaging and helped keep my interest throughout. In fact, the story commenced with a mini-mystery involving the identity of the owner of a walking cane left in Holmes' office. Dr Watson produced a very sound analysis of what type of person the owner might be by observing such things as wear and tear and bite marks on the cane itself. However, after Watson's seemingly brilliant observations - Holmes then proceeded to critically tear apart Watson's assumptions and arguments, piece by piece, until the poor man's position was totally and irrevocably obliterated. This seems to be a bit of a theme - if I was Dr Watson, not sure I'd hang around with a bloke like Sherlock. Yet, despite this condescending treatment, Dr Watson seems to have almost a sycophantic relationship with Sherlock. It must be said though, Sherlock Holmes is a very impressive character. His lines of reasoning and modus operandi are always logical and altogether brilliant. To me, his powers of deduction always seemed to be sensible, he used very linear arguments and despite the red herrings lying about the place - he made complete sense. The narration by Dr Watson is a great tool used by the author to not only explain what was going on but to re-empathise parts of the narrative that may be a bit too complex (for my addled brain anyway), but he also used instruments such as Dr Watson's written reports to Holmes, to further cement the plot into the readers mind."	152	en

341	Hamlet, Prince of Denmark	William Shakespeare	2003	The New Cambridge Shakespeare appeals to students worldwide for its up-to-date scholarship and emphasis on performance. The series features line-by-line commentaries and textual notes on the plays and poems. Introductions are regularly refreshed with accounts of new critical, stage and screen interpretations. This second edition of Hamlet, edited by Philip Edwards, brings readers, playgoers and directors into the closest possible contact with Shakespeare's most famous and perplexing play. In the introduction, Edwards explores the possibility that Shakespeare made important alterations to Hamlet as it neared production, creating differences between the two early texts, quarto and folio. Edwards concentrates on essentials, dealing succinctly with the huge volume of commentary and controversy that the play has provoked, and offers a way forward that enables us to recognise Hamlet's full tragic energy. In a new supplementary section, Robert Hapgood discusses recent stage, film and critical interpretations of the play.	273	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=adqzIJYqdnYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Dick	2008	A masterpiece ahead of its time, a prescient rendering of a dark future, and the inspiration for the blockbuster film Blade Runner By 2021, the World War has killed millions, driving entire species into extinction and sending mankind off-planet. Those who remain covet any living creature, and for people who can’t afford one, companies built incredibly realistic simulacra: horses, birds, cats, sheep. They’ve even built humans. Immigrants to Mars receive androids so sophisticated they are indistinguishable from true men or women. Fearful of the havoc these artificial humans can wreak, the government bans them from Earth. Driven into hiding, unauthorized androids live among human beings, undetected. Rick Deckard, an officially sanctioned bounty hunter, is commissioned to find rogue androids and “retire” them.

Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zoë, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zoë at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man.

375	The Complete Novels of Jane Austen, Volume I	Jane Austen	2013	The first volume in the Complete Novels of Jane Austen, this volume contains the classics Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY Sense and Sensibility was the first of Jane Austen's novels to be published, coming out in 1811. It had a long gestation, beginning as Elinor and Marianne, an epistolary novel that Austen wrote in the 1790s. The novel centers on the sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are forced to leave their home with their mother and younger sister, Margaret, and move in reduced circumstances to the West of England. Elinor, the sensible sister, and Marianne, the overimaginative romantic, must rely on a good marriage as a means of support. As their excellent schemes are intruded upon, Austen subtly explores the marriage game of her times, as both sense and sensibility affect the sisters' chances of happiness and comfort. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.” So begins Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen’s witty comedy of manners—one of the most popular novels of all time—that features splendidly civilized sparring between the proud Mr. Darcy and the prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet as they play out their spirited courtship in a series of eighteenth-century drawing-room intrigues. Renowned literary critic and historian George Saintsbury in 1894 declared it the “most perfect, the most characteristic, the most eminently quintessential of its author’s works,” and Eudora Welty in the twentieth century described it as “irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be.” MANSFIELD PARK Mansfield Park shows Austen as a mature novelist with an almost unparalleled ability to render character and an acute awareness of her world and how it was changing. Through the stories of Fanny Price, the Bertrams, and the Crawfords, she tackles the themes of faith and constancy and the threat that metropolitan manners could pose to a rural way of life. Mansfield Park is as amusing as any of Austen's novels, but, according to the critic Tony Tanner, it is also arguable that it is “her most profound novel (indeed . . . it is one of the most profound novels of the nineteenth century).”	912	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G_rp1GRKG7EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

380	War and Peace	Leo Tolstoy	2008	From Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, the best-selling, award-winning translators of Anna Karenina and The Brothers Karamazov, comes a brilliant, engaging, and eminently readable translation of Leo Tolstoy’s master epic. • Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read War and Peace centers broadly on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the best-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves behind his family to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman, who intrigues both men. As Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy vividly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature. Pevear and Volokhonsky have brought us this classic novel in a translation remarkable for its fidelity to Tolstoy’s style and cadence and for its energetic, accessible prose.	1298	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bL3VlijouIwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

A shy and sweet-tempered girl adopted by wealthy relations, Fanny is an outsider looking in on an unfamiliar, and often inhospitable, world. But Fanny eventually wins the affection of her benefactors, endearing herself to the Bertram family and the reader alike. In her Introduction, Carol Shields writes, [Mansfield Park's] overriding theme is difficult to isolate, since the novel is about everything it touches upon: nurturing, steadfastness, belonging and not belonging, about fine gradations of moral persuasion, about human noise and silence, and about action and stillness.	448	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqzsQ6yRZf0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
397	Cloud Atlas (20th Anniversary Edition)	David Mitchell	2008	#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A new edition of the timeless, structure-bending classic that explores how actions of individual lives impact the past, present and future—from a postmodern visionary and one of the leading voices in fiction Features a new afterword by David Mitchell and a new introduction by Gabrielle Zevin, author of Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow One of the New York Times’s 100 Best Books of the 21st Century • Shortlisted for the International Booker Prize • A Kirkus Reviews Best Fiction Book of the Century Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. The novel careens, with dazzling virtuosity, to Belgium in 1931, to the West Coast in the 1970s, to an inglorious present-day England, to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok, and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history. But the story doesn’t end even there. The novel boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, David Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky. As wild as a video game, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.	530	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-sapXk7dWcAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

399	Steppenwolf	Hermann Hesse	2025	Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse’s iconic countercultural novel about the search for authenticity in an inauthentic world, in a new translation A Penguin Classic At first glance, Harry Haller seems like a respectable, educated man. In reality, he is the Steppenwolf: wild, strange, alienated from society, and repulsed by the modern age. But as he is drawn into a series of dreamlike and sometimes savage encounters—accompanied by, among others, Mozart, Goethe, and the bewitching Hermione—the misanthropic Haller undergoes a spiritual, even psychedelic, journey, and ultimately discovers a higher truth and the possibility of happiness. This blistering portrait of a man who feels himself to be half human and half wolf was the bible of the 1960s counterculture, capturing the mood of a disaffected generation. It continues to resonate as a haunting story of estrangement, redemption, and the search for one’s place in the world.	257	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9EuhEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

420	Midnight's Children	Salman Rushdie	2010	The iconic masterpiece of India that introduced the world to “a glittering novelist—one with startling imaginative and intellectual resources, a master of perpetual storytelling” (The New Yorker) WINNER OF THE BEST OF THE BOOKERS • SOON TO BE A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time • The fortieth anniversary edition, featuring a new introduction by the author Saleem Sinai is born at the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947, the very moment of India’s independence. Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country. Perhaps most remarkable are the telepathic powers linking him with India’s 1,000 other “midnight’s children,” all born in that initial hour and endowed with magical gifts. This novel is at once a fascinating family saga and an astonishing evocation of a vast land and its people–a brilliant incarnation of the universal human comedy. Forty years after its publication, Midnight’s Children stands apart as both an epochal work of fiction and a brilliant performance by one of the great literary voices of our time.	597	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IT6vfrb5fNcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Then, suddenly, Mitch’s vague suspicions come to life. The FBI has the lowdown on Mitch’s firm and needs his help. Now Mitch is caught between a rock and a hard place. The FBI will bust him if he doesn’t cooperate, and the firm will kill him if he does. There’s no way out. Or is there?

426	The Plague	Albert Camus	2021	"“We can finally read the work as Camus meant it to be read. Laura Marris’s new translation of The Plague is, quite simply, the translation we need to have.” —Los Angeles Review of Books The first new translation of The Plague to be published in the United States in more than seventy years, bringing the Nobel Prize winner's iconic novel to a new generation of readers. • ""A redemptive book, one that wills the reader to believe, even in a time of despair."" —The Washington Post The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation, and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, as well as a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence. In this fresh yet careful translation, award-winning translator Laura Marris breathes new life into Albert Camus's ever-resonant tale. Restoring the restrained lyricism of the original French text, and liberating it from the archaisms and assumptions of the previous English translation, Marris grants English readers the closest access we have ever had to the meaning and searing beauty of The Plague. This updated edition promises to add relevance and urgency to a classic novel of twentieth-century literature."	353	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-6FHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

436	Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil	John Berendt	1994	NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A modern classic of true crime, set in a most beguiling Southern city—now in a 30th anniversary edition with a new afterword by the author The basis for the upcoming Broadway musical, coming in 2025! “Elegant and wicked . . . might be the first true-crime book that makes the reader want to book a bed and breakfast for an extended weekend at the scene of the crime.”—The New York Times Book Review Shots rang out in Savannah’s grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. In this sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative, John Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman’s Card Club; the turbulent young gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the “soul of pampered self-absorption”; the uproariously funny drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young people dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a sublime and seductive reading experience.	417	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zrhPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

440	The Origin of Species	Charles Darwin	1998	Introduction by Edward J. Larson ﻿Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific inquiry, The Origin of Species sold out its first printing on the very day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England and, as the Saturday Review noted, the uproar over the book quickly “passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street.” Based largely on Darwin’s experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H. M. S. Beagle, The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species. This Modern Library edition includes a Foreword by the Pulitzer Prize–winning science historian Edward J. Larson, an introductory historical sketch, and a glossary Darwin later added to the original text.	721	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DLdPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

452	Death of a Salesman	Arthur Miller	1976	"The Pulitzer Prize-winning tragedy of a salesman’s deferred American dream Ever since it was first performed in 1949, Death of a Salesman has been recognized as a milestone of the American theater. In the person of Willy Loman, the aging, failing salesman who makes his living riding on a smile and a shoeshine, Arthur Miller redefined the tragic hero as a man whose dreams are at once insupportably vast and dangerously insubstantial. He has given us a figure whose name has become a symbol for a kind of majestic grandiosity—and a play that compresses epic extremes of humor and anguish, promise and loss, between the four walls of an American living room. ""By common consent, this is one of the finest dramas in the whole range of the American theater."" —Brooks Atkinson, The New York Times ""So simple, central, and terrible that the run of playwrights would neither care nor dare to attempt it."" —Time"	145	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NolPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
453	Unbroken	Laura Hillenbrand	2014	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The incredible true story of survival and salvation that is the basis for two major motion pictures: Unbroken and Unbroken: Path to Redemption. “Extraordinarily moving . . . a powerfully drawn survival epic.”—The Wall Street Journal Hailed as the top nonfiction book of the year by Time magazine • Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War. The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will. Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.	530	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1PeLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness. In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (“women’s writing”). Some girls were paired with laotongs, “old sames,” in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become “old sames” at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.	290	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sbh77-4Xjs4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

469	Faust	Johann Wolfgang von Goethe	2011	Goethe’s masterpiece and perhaps the greatest work in German literature, Faust has made the legendary German alchemist one of the central myths of the Western world. Here indeed is a monumental Faust, an audacious man boldly wagering with the devil, Mephistopheles, that no magic, sensuality, experience, or knowledge can lead him to a moment he would wish to last forever. Here, in Faust, Part I, the tremendous versatility of Goethe’s genius creates some of the most beautiful passages in literature. Here too we experience Goethe’s characteristic humor, the excitement and eroticism of the witches’ Walpurgis Night, and the moving emotion of Gretchen’s tragic fate. This authoritative edition, which offers Peter Salm’s wonderfully readable translation as well as the original German on facing pages, brings us Faust in a vital, rhythmic American idiom that carefully preserves the grandeur, integrity, and poetic immediacy of Goethe’s words.	466	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KPCAbnG-ruYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.

Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens. Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Delia Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.	481	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LmRlEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake. The Devil in the White City draws the reader into the enchantment of the Guilded Age, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. Erik Larson’s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.	465	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1g2PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
472	Circe	Madeline Miller	2019	Di istana Helios, dewa matahari, lahir seorang anak perempuan. Tetapi Circe anak yang aneh––tidak berkuasa seperti ayahnya, juga tidak memikat seperti ibunya. Karena tak punya teman, Circe mencarinya di dunia manusia, dan mengembangkan kemampuannya sebagai penyihir. Zeus, yang merasa terancam, mengasingkannya ke pulau terpencil. Circe mengasah bakatnya dan bertemu banyak tokoh paling termasyhur dalam mitologi, di antaranya Minotaur, Daedalus dan Icarus, Medea, dan Odysseus yang lihai.

Untuk melindungi apa yang paling dicintainya, Circe harus mengerahkan seluruh kekuatannya dan memilih dengan tegas, apakah hendak berpihak kepada dewa-dewa yang telah melahirkannya, atau manusia yang telanjur disayanginya.	546	id	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GrGdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It's funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.""—Zoë Kravitz From the bestselling author of Funny Girl, About a Boy, A Long Way Down and Dickens and Prince, a wise and hilarious novel about love, heartbreak, and rock and roll. Rob is a pop music junkie who runs his own semi-failing record store. His girlfriend, Laura, has just left him for the guy upstairs, and Rob is both miserable and relieved. After all, could he have spent his life with someone who has a bad record collection? Rob seeks refuge in the company of the offbeat clerks at his store, who endlessly review their top five films; top five Elvis Costello songs; top five episodes of Cheers. Rob tries dating a singer, but maybe it’s just that he’s always wanted to sleep with someone who has a record contract. Then he sees Laura again. And Rob begins to think that life with kids, marriage, barbecues, and soft rock CDs might not be so bad."	337	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qq1PEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

475	The Shipping News	Annie Proulx	2008	Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Annie Proulx’s The Shipping News is a vigorous, darkly comic, and at times magical portrait of the contemporary North American family. Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a “head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips,” is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just desserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle’s Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family’s unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it’s easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph—in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover’s knot.	360	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jHp8VHqgCmQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

477	Northanger Abbey	Jane Austen	2002	Jane Austen’s first novel, Northanger Abbey—published posthumously in 1818—tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen’s fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical Northanger Abbey pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex. This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the first edition of 1818.	258	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Nqg_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
478	The Tales of Beedle the Bard	J. K. Rowling	2017	The Tales of Beedle the Bard have been favourite bedtime reading in wizarding households for centuries. Full of magic and trickery, these classic tales both entertain and instruct, and remain as captivating to young wizards today as they were when Beedle first put quill to parchment in the fifteenth century. There are five tales in all: 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' Harry Potter fans will know from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; 'The Fountain of Fair Fortune', 'The Warlock's Hairy Heart', 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot' and 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump' complete the collection. These narrative gems are accompanied by explanatory notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore (included by kind permission of the Hogwarts Headmaster's archive). His illuminating thoughts reveal the stories to be much more than just simple moral tales, and are sure to make Babbitty Rabbitty and the slug-belching Hopping Pot as familiar to Muggles as Snow White and Cinderella. This brand new edition of these much loved fairy tales from the wizarding world pairs J.K. Rowling's original text with gorgeous jacket art by Jonny Duddle and line illustrations throughout by Tomislav Tomic. The Tales of Beedle the Bard is published in aid of the Lumos (link to wearelumos.org), an international children's charity (registered charity number 1112575) founded in 2005 by J.K Rowling. Lumos is dedicated ending the institutionalisation of children, a harmful practice that affects the lives of up to eight million disadvantaged children around the world who live in institutions and orphanages, many placed there as a result of poverty, disability, disease, discrimination and conflict; very few are orphans. Lumos works to reunite children with their families, promote family-based care alternatives and help authorities to reform their systems and close down institutions and orphanages.	0	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7PehDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
479	The Chosen	Chaim Potok	2016	A coming-of-age classic about two Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s, this “profound and universal” (The Wall Street Journal) story of faith, family, tradition, and assimilation remains deeply pertinent today. “Works of this caliber should be occasion for singing in the streets and shouting from the rooftops.” —Chicago Tribune It’s the spring of 1944 and fifteen-year-olds Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders have lived five blocks apart all their lives. But they’ve never met, not until the day an accident at a softball game sparks an unlikely friendship. Soon these two boys—one expected to become a Hasidic rebbe, the other at ease with secular America—are drawn into one another’s worlds despite a father’s strong opposition. Set against the backdrop of World War II and the creation of the state of Israel, The Chosen is a poignant novel about transformation and tradition, growing up and growing wise, and finding yourself—even if it might mean disappointing those you love.	272	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TZN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
480	Houdini Heart	Ki Longfellow	2011	"HOUDINI HEART harkens back to the masters of suspenseful supernatural horror: Poe, Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, but speaks with a wholly fresh voice. Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror. Gripped by River House, trapped in an aging hotel of mirrors only Houdini could escape, how much can haunt a mind before it too is only a thing once imagined? ""A haunting and disturbing journey through the psyche.""-Erika Mailman, Author of ""The Witch's Trinity"""	254	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5WYgKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Sterling is an ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens--until the day its complacency is shattered by a school shooting. Josie Cormier, the daughter of the judge sitting on the case, should be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened before her very own eyes--or can she? As the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show--destroying the closest of friendships and families. Nineteen Minutes asks what it means to be different in our society, who has the right to judge someone else, and whether anyone is ever really who they seem to be.	465	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSMxgQp2bMUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

485	To the Lighthouse	Virginia Woolf	2006	"'I am making up ""To the Lighthouse"" - the sea is to be heard all through it' Inspired by the lost bliss of her childhood summers in Cornwall, Virginia Woolf produced one of the masterworks of English literature in To the Lighthouse. It concerns the Ramsay family and their summer guests on the Isle of Skye before and after the First World War. As children play and adults paint, talk, muse and explore, relationships shift and mutate. A captivating fusion of elegy, autobiography, socio-political critique and visionary thrust, it is the most accomplished of all Woolf's novels. On completing it, she thought she had exorcised the ghosts of her imposing parents, but she had also brought form to a book every bit as vivid and intense as the work of Lily Briscoe, the indomitable artist at the centre of the novel."	261	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pYIBIIyQGZ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

491	I, Robot	Isaac Asimov	2004	This classic science fiction masterwork by Isaac Asimov weaves stories about robots, humanity, and the deep questions of existence into a novel of shocking intelligence and heart. “A must-read for science-fiction buffs and literature enjoyers alike.”—The Guardian I, Robot, the first and most widely read book in Asimov’s Robot series, forever changed the world’s perception of artificial intelligence. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-reading robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world—all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asimov’s trademark. The Three Laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov formulated the laws governing robots’ behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future—a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. “Tremendously exciting and entertaining . . . Asimov dramatizes an interesting question: How can we live with machines that, generation by generation, grow more intelligent than their creators and not eventually clash with our own invention?”—The Chicago Tribune	239	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2vnbMzYXBQsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic. ""I took this with me wherever I went and stole every second I had to read! Absorbing, hilarious, tender, sexy—this book had everything I crave.

497	Dubliners	James Joyce	1993	A definitive edition of perhaps the greatest short story collection in the English language James Joyce’s Dubliners is a vivid and unflinching portrait of “dear dirty Dublin” at the turn of the twentieth century. These fifteen stories, including such unforgettable ones as “Araby,” “Grace,” and “The Dead,” delve into the heart of the city of Joyce’s birth, capturing the cadences of Dubliners’ speech and portraying with an almost brute realism their outer and inner lives. Dubliners is Joyce at his most accessible and most profound, and this edition is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author’s original wishes.

498	The Waste Land and Other Poems	T. S. Eliot	2003	A Penguin Classic While recovering from a mental collapse in a Swiss sanitarium in 1921, T. S. Eliot finished what became the definitive poem of the modern condition, one that still casts a large and ominous shadow over twentieth-century poetry. Built upon the imagery of the Grail legend, the Fisher King, and ancient fertility cults, “The Waste Land” is both a poetic diagnosis of an ailing civilization and a desperate quest for spiritual renewal. Through pastiche and collage Eliot unfolds a nightmarish landscape of sexual disorder and spiritual desolation, inhabited by the voice (literary, historical, mythic, contemporary) of an unconscious that is at turns deeply personal and culturally collective. This edition includes “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” “Portrait of a Lady,” “Gerontion,” and more. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

502	The Goldfinch	Donna Tartt	2013	"A young New Yorker grieving his mother's death is pulled into a gritty underworld of art and wealth in this “extraordinary” and beloved novel that ""connects with the heart as well as the mind"" (Stephen King, New York Times Book Review), named a New York Times Best Book of the 21st Century. Theo Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community. As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love — and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The Goldfinch is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention. From the streets of New York to the dark corners of the art underworld, this ""soaring masterpiece"" examines the devastating impact of grief and the ruthless machinations of fate (Ron Charles, Washington Post)."	820	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dvuK7isszLIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Then, on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull's egg, as ""perfect as the moon."" With the pearl comes hope, the promise of comfort and of security.... A story of classic simplicity, based on a Mexican folk tale, The Pearl explores the secrets of man's nature, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love."	97	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N80nEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
506	The Twilight Collection	Stephenie Meyer	2008	It is the near future, and the earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of their human hosts while leaving their bodies intact. Wanderer, one of the invading 'souls', knew about the challenges of living inside a human - the overwhelming emotions, the too-vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body, Melanie Stryder, refuses to fade away into oblivion the way she should. Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of the man she loves - Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she's never met. As outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love. Featuring what may be the first love triangle that involves only two bodies, THE HOST is a riveting and unforgettable novel.		en	
507	Plato: 'The Republic'	Plato	2000	First published in 2000, this translation of one of the great works of Western political thought is based on the assumption that when Plato chose the dialogue form for his writing, he intended these dialogues to sound like conversations - although conversations of a philosophical sort. In addition to a vivid, dignified and accurate rendition of Plato's text, the student and general reader will find many aids to comprehension in this volume: an introduction that assesses the cultural background to the Republic, its place within political philosophy, and its general argument; succinct notes in the body of the text; an analytical summary of the work's content; a full glossary of proper names; a chronology of important events; and a guide to further reading. The result is an accomplished and accessible edition of this seminal work, suitable for philosophers and classicists as well as historians of political thought at all levels.	444	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aPwPjVIxbGQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
508	The Jungle	Upton Sinclair	2008	Upton Sinclair's dramatic and deeply moving story exposed the brutal conditions in the Chicago stockyards at the turn of the nineteenth century and brought into sharp moral focus the appalling odds against which immigrants and other working people struggled for their share of the American dream. Denounced by the conservative press as an un-American libel on the meatpacking industry, the book was championed by more progressive thinkers, including then President Theodore Roosevelt, and was a major catalyst to the passing of the Pure Food and Meat Inspection act, which has tremendous impact to this day. Enriched eBook Features Editor Jonathan Beecher Field provides the following specially commissioned features for this Enriched eBook Classic: * Chronology * Filmography (and the 1914 The Jungle Film Poster) * Early Twentieth-Century Reviews of The Jungle * Suggestions for Further Reading * The Jungle and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 * The Jungle Book Cover Designs * Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 * Immigrants and the Meatpacking Industry, Then and Now * Images of the Chicago Stockyards * Images of Cuts of Beef and Pork * Enriched eBook Notes The enriched eBook format invites readers to go beyond the pages of these beloved works and gain more insight into the life and times of an author and the period in which the book was originally written for a rich reading experience.	449	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9qu7SX_brhUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

513	Me Talk Pretty One Day	David Sedaris	2009	A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child.

514	Voyager	Diana Gabaldon	2001	NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The third book in Diana Gabaldon’s acclaimed Outlander saga, the basis for the Starz original series. “Triumphant . . . Her use of historical detail and a truly adult love story confirm Gabaldon as a superior writer.”—Publishers Weekly In this rich, vibrant tale, Diana Gabaldon continues the story of Claire Randall and Jamie Fraser that began with the now-classic novel Outlander and continued in Dragonfly in Amber. Sweeping us from the battlefields of eighteenth-century Scotland to the West Indies, Diana Gabaldon weaves magic once again in an exhilarating and utterly unforgettable novel. He was dead. However, his nose throbbed painfully, which he thought odd in the circumstances. Jamie Fraser is, alas, not dead—but he is in hell. Waking among the fallen on Culloden Field, he is concerned neither for his men nor his wounds but for his wife and their unborn child. Lord, he prayed passionately, that she may be safe. She and the child. It’s a prayer he’ll utter many times over the next twenty years, never knowing but always hoping that Claire made it through the standing stones, back to the safety of her own time. Safe she is, but believing Jamie gone forever, she’s obliged to live without a heart, her only comfort their daughter, Brianna. But now, their daughter grown, she discovers that Jamie survived, and a fateful decision lies before her: Stay with her beloved daughter, or go back to search Scotland’s dangerous past for the man who was her heart and soul, sustained only by the hope that they will still know each other if she finds him.	882	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tJ1Ywslye6kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past. By turns comic and tragic, but always passionate, wildly inventive, and touched with an indelible humanity, this debut novel is a powerful, deeply felt story of searching: for the past, family, and truth.	290	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xPcWJ_Zr0MYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

She encounters George at her hotel and is immediately fascinated by him, for he seems the exact opposite of her family: unpretentious, unconventional and full of life.

Returning to Britain, she finds herself torn between society’s expectations of her and what she secretly wants for herself.	191	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xoSkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
525	The War of the Worlds	H.G. Wells	2017	Read this stunning Vintage Classics edition of the original story of alien invasion from the father of science fiction, H.G. Wells. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied. Yet across the gulf of space, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. Then, late one night, in the middle of the English countryside, they landed.	210	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dkLjCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This edition has an afterword by David Stuart Davies and original illustrations by H. K. Browne. The inheritance case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been going on for generations involving myriad characters from all walks of life. There’s Esther Summerson, Dickens' feisty heroine; Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, cocooned in their stately home in Lincolnshire; and Jo, the penniless crossing sweeper. We are drawn in and fascinated by the complex relationships. Indeed in none of Charles Dickens’ other novels is the canvas broader, the sweep more inclusive, the linguistic texture richer and the gallery of comic grotesques more extraordinary.	1062	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ja6oDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

533	The Woman in White	Wilkie Collins	1991	"Wilkie Collins's classic thriller took the world by storm on its first appearance in 1859, with everything from dances to perfumes to dresses named in honor of the ""woman in white."" The novel's continuing fascination stems in part from a distinctive blend of melodrama, comedy, and realism; and in part from the power of its story. The catalyst for the mystery is Walter Hartright's encounter on a moonlit road with a mysterious woman dressed head to toe in white. She is in a state of confusion and distress, and when Hartright helps her find her way back to London she warns him against an unnamed ""man of rank and title."" Hartright soon learns that she may have escaped from an asylum and finds to his amazement that her story may be connected to that of the woman he secretly loves. Collins brilliantly uses the device of multiple narrators to weave a story in which no one can be trusted, and he also famously creates, in the figure of Count Fosco, the prototype of the suave, sophisticated evil genius. The Woman in White is still passed as a masterpiece of narrative drive and excruciating suspense.

535	World War Z	Max Brooks	2006	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Prepare to be entranced by this addictively readable oral history of the great war between humans and zombies.”—Entertainment Weekly We survived the zombie apocalypse, but how many of us are still haunted by that terrible time? We have (temporarily?) defeated the living dead, but at what cost? Told in the haunting and riveting voices of the men and women who witnessed the horror firsthand, World War Z is the only record of the pandemic. The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.

537	The God Delusion	Richard Dawkins	2011	A preeminent scientist—and the world's most prominent atheist—asserts the irrationality of belief in God and the grievous harm religion has inflicted on society, from the Crusades to 9/11. With rigor and wit, Dawkins examines God in all his forms, from the sex-obsessed tyrant of the Old Testament to the more benign (but still illogical) Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.	465	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yq1xDpicghkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

542	Brideshead Revisited	Evelyn Waugh	2012	"Selected by Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the century and called ""Evelyn Waugh's finest achievement"" by the New York Times, Brideshead Revisited is a stunning exploration of desire, duty, and memory. The wellsprings of desire and the impediments to love come brilliantly into focus in Evelyn Waugh's masterpiece — a novel that immerses us in the glittering and seductive world of English aristocracy in the waning days of the empire. Through the story of Charles Ryder's entanglement with the Flytes, a great Catholic family, Evelyn Waugh charts the passing of the privileged world he knew in his own youth and vividly recalls the sensuous pleasures denied him by wartime austerities. At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, Brideshead Revisited transcends Waugh's early satiric explorations and reveals him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity. ""A genuine literary masterpiece."" —Time ""Heartbreakingly beautiful...The twentieth century's finest English novel."" —Los Angeles Times"	305	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CSE2P06rVUoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
543	Ugly Love	Colleen Hoover	2014	From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Regretting You, Verity, and It Ends with Us comes a hauntingly seductive tale of love, control, and the devastating secrets that can destroy it all. When Tate Collins moves in with her brother, the last thing she expects is to collide with Miles Archer, a brooding pilot with an unrelenting grip on his past. Their attraction is electric, undeniable, and all-consuming—but Miles has rules. No questions. No future. A no-strings arrangement seems simple at first, but a deep, shattering truth lurks just beneath the surface. Tate soon realizes that Miles is not just guarded but fractured. Torn between desire and self-destruction, his pain bleeds into every part of their dynamic. Miles’s past hides horrors that threaten to rip apart the fragile connection they’ve created, and Tate is forced to make a choice that will change both their lives forever. With suspense simmering underneath every moment of passion, Ugly Love is a whirlwind of lust, heartbreak, and dark revelations that build to a stunning crescendo. For those drawn to the raw tension and psychological complexities of Verity, this is a riveting story where emotions erupt, secrets fester, and love may not be enough to heal the deep scars etched into the past.	336	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QF1GAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
544	Sense and Sensibility	Jane Austen	2001	"Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, is a witty satire of the sentimental novel, a popular genre in Britain throughout the 1790s and the Regency. When it first appeared in 1811, the words in its title carried significant cultural weight beyond the confines of the novel, and into both popular and learned discourse. Through her dual heroines, Austen addresses, and satirizes, notions of sense and sensibility, and engages with the issues of inheritance, marriage, and love. The story concerns two sisters: the level-headed Elinor and the passionate and impulsive Marianne. When their father dies, his son by a previous marriage assumes possession of the family home. Marianne and Elinor, left to the care of their mercenary brother John and his wife Fanny, must remove to a cottage with their mother. Each sister meets a man in whom she is interested, and as with other Austen novels, requited love does not come easily. This newly annotated edition offers a thorough and perceptive introduction and a wide range of carefully selected contextual materials that further explore the term ""sensibility."""	434	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IPuBp_4CL6oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The only relief from the sea of logos is within the autonomous city-states, where law-abiding citizens don’t dare leave their mansions. Hiro delivers pizza to the mansions for a living, defending his pies from marauders when necessary with a matched set of samurai swords. His home is a shared 20 X 30 U-Stor-It. He spends most of his time goggled in to the Metaverse, where his avatar is legendary. But in the club known as The Black Sun, his fellow hackers are being felled by a weird new drug called Snow Crash that reduces them to nothing more than a jittering cloud of bad digital karma (and IRL, a vegetative state). Investigating the Infocalypse leads Hiro all the way back to the beginning of language itself, with roots in an ancient Sumerian priesthood. He’ll be joined by Y.T., a fearless teenaged skateboard courier. Together, they must race to stop a shadowy virtual villain hell-bent on world domination.	482	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RMd3GpIFxcUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Now in one deluxe box set, the first four novels in the Crossfire series. The #1 New York Times bestselling author. The #1 worldwide phenomenon. Bared to You He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily... Gideon knew. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds... and desires. The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart... Reflected in You Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction my every desire mine. My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We'd never work. It was too hard, too painful except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession Entwined with You From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn't resist. I also saw the dangerous and damaged soul insideso much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat. No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I'd been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become. Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession... Captivated by You Gideon calls me his angel, but he's the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own. The vows we'd exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn't sure I was strong enough to bear. At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we'd worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we'd had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream...	0	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=75aNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
556	Cannery Row (Cannery Row, #1)	John Steinbeck	2022	"Cannery Row is a book with a minimally developed plot. Instead, it's an attempt to depict the atmosphere and characters of a particular place-the cannery neighbourhood of Monterey, California, which is home to a mix of the poor and individuals who prefer not to live ""up the hill"" in the more respectable part of town for a variety of reasons. Short vignettes that introduce us to different Row residents, the majority of whom are not directly related to the main story, regularly interrupt the main plot's pace. These short stories frequently make reference to extreme violence, including suicides, bodies, and the brutality of nature.The adventures of Mack and the guys, a gang of resourceful unemployed men who live in a renovated fish-meal shanty on the edge of an empty lot down on the Row, are the ""narrative"" of Cannery Row."	0	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=COWUzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

562	Far from the Madding Crowd	Thomas Hardy	2011	This updated authoritative edition of the classic Hardy novel, which was published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, is set from Hardy's revised, unedited final draft of 1912 and features a new Introduction and Afterword. There is in England no more real or typical district than Thomas Hardy's imaginary Wessex, the scattered fields and farms of which were first discovered in Far from the Madding Crowd. It is here that Gabriel Oak observes Bathsheba, the young mistress of Weatherbury Farm, fall victim to her amorous caprices. He stands by her through one marriage to a handsome, corruptly sentimental sergeant. Selflessly altruistic, he sees her through another betrothal to her compulsive, puritanical neighbor-as unaware as she of the stroke of Fate that will effect their ultimate union. Published anonymously and first attributed to George Eliot, Far from the Madding Crowd won Hardy immediate success; it combines an architecturally perfect plot with the philosophical overtones that were to set the theme for all his later works. The text of this Signet Classic is set from Hardy's revised final version of Far from the Madding Crowd , published in 1912 in the authoritative Wessex edition.	413	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XlmhDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

567	Into Thin Air	Jon Krakauer	1997	When Jon Krakauer reached the summit of Mt. Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated. Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996. Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement. Into the Wild is available on audio, read by actor Campbell Scott.	318	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3FONDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Their lives collide in one tragic, stormy night, where an act of arson and nature leave Kaylie and two others dead and Toby just barely alive – with no memory of who he is. The fisherman who pulls him from the ocean enlists Hannah to help save the very person who she knows took away her sister.

580	Anne of Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables #2)	L. M. Montgomery	2020	Anne is about to start her first term teaching at the Avonlea school, although she will still continue her studies at home with Gilbert, who is teaching at the nearby White Sands School. The book soon introduces Anne's new and problematic neighbor, Mr. Harrison, and his foul-mouthed parrot, as well as the twins, Davy and Dora. They are the children of Marilla's third cousin and she takes them in when their mother dies while their uncle is out of the country. Dora is a nice, well-behaved girl, somewhat boring in her perfect behaviour. Davy is Dora's exact opposite, much more of a handful and constantly getting into many scrapes. They are initially meant to stay only a short time, but the twins' uncle postpones his return to collect the twins and then eventually dies. Both Anne and Marilla are relieved (Marilla inwardly of course) to know the twins will remain with her.	242	en

614	Demian: Die Geschichte von Emil Sinclairs Jugend	Hermann Hesse	2022	"In ""Demian: Die Geschichte von Emil Sinclairs Jugend"" entfaltet Hermann Hesse eine tiefgründige Coming-of-Age-Erzählung, die sich mit der Suche nach Identität und Selbstverständnis auseinandersetzt. Der Roman, der im literarischen Kontext der Moderne und des Expressionismus steht, verwebt psychologische und philosophische Elemente in eine fesselnde Handlung. Emil Sinclair, der Protagonist, wird durch die Begegnung mit dem mysteriösen Max Demian herausgefordert, seine duale Weltanschauung zu überdenken und sich den dunklen Seiten seines Wesens zu stellen. Hesses lyrischer Stil und die symbolisch aufgeladenen Motive machen das Werk zu einer komplexen Meditation über Licht und Schatten der menschlichen Existenz. Hermann Hesse, ein bedeutender deutscher Schriftsteller und Nobelpreisträger, schuf mit ""Demian"" ein Werk, das stark von seinen eigenen Erfahrungen und der Auseinandersetzung mit psychologischen und spirituellen Themen geprägt ist. Hesse, der in den turbulenten Zeiten des Ersten Weltkriegs lebte, suchte nach Antworten auf die existenziellen Fragen des Lebens, was sich in Sinclairs innerer Reise widerspiegelt. Diese persönliche Dimension, kombiniert mit Hesses Interessen an Psychologie und Kunst, macht ""Demian"" zu einem Schlüsselerlebnis seiner literarischen Laufbahn. ""Demian"" ist ein unverzichtbares Werk für alle, die sich mit der Komplexität des menschlichen Lebens auseinandersetzen möchten. Leser, die bereit sind, sich auf eine tiefgründige und manchmal auch herausfordernde Reise der Selbstentdeckung einzulassen, werden in diesem Buch nicht nur einen literarischen Schatz, sondern auch einen Leitfaden für die eigene Selbsterkenntnis finden. Hesses meisterhafte Erzählkunst lädt dazu ein, über das eigene Dasein und die Suche nach Wahrheit nachzudenken."	148	de	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=27OcEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

624	Cyrano de Bergerac	Edmond Rostand	2016	Edmond Rostand's classic romance tells the unforgettable story of one unique man's bravery, loyalty, and unspoken love. Set in seventeenth century Paris, the action revolves around the emotional problems of the noble, swashbuckling Cyrano, who, despite his many gifts, feels that no woman can ever love him because he has an enormous nose. Secretly in love with the lovely Roxane, Cyrano agrees to help his inarticulate rival, Christian, win her heart by allowing him to present Cyrano's love poems, speeches, and letters as his own work. Eventually Christian recognizes that Roxane loves him for Cyrano's qualities, not his own, and he asks Cyrano to confess his identity to Roxane; Christian then goes off to a battle that proves fatal. Cyrano remains silent about his own part in Roxane's courtship. As he is dying years later, he visits Roxane and recites one of the love letters. Roxane realizes that it is Cyrano she loves, and he dies content.

The iconic, “extraordinary” (The Washington Post) collaboration between bestselling authors Stephen King and Peter Straub—an epic #1 New York Times bestselling fantasy thriller about a young boy’s quest to save his mother’s life. Jack Sawyer, twelve years old, is about to begin a most fantastic journey, an exalting, terrifying quest for the mystical Talisman—the only thing that can save Jack’s dying mother. But to reach his goal, Jack must make his way not only across the breadth of the United States but also through the wondrous and menacing parallel world of the Territories. In the Territories, Jack finds another realm, where the air is so sweet and clear a man can smell a radish being pulled from the ground a mile away—and a life can be snuffed out instantly in the continuing struggle between good and evil. Here Jack discovers “Twinners,” reflections of the people he knows on earth—most notably Queen Laura DeLoessian, the Twinner of Jack’s own imperiled mother. As Jack “flips” between worlds, making his way westward toward the redemptive Talisman, a sequence of heart-stopping encounters challenges him at every step. An unforgettable epic of adventure and resounding triumph, The Talisman is one of the most influential and highly praised works of fantasy ever written.	944	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=08GTcZMkvz4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

627	World Without End	Ken Follett	2007	"#1 New York Times Bestseller In 1989, Ken Follett astonished the literary world with The Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected. World Without End is its equally irresistible sequel—set two hundred years after The Pillars of the Earth and three hundred years after the Kingsbridge prequel, The Evening and the Morning. World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroads of new ideas—about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race—the Black Death. Three years in the writing and nearly eighteen years since its predecessor, World Without End is a ""well-researched, beautifully detailed portrait of the late Middle Ages"" (The Washington Post) that once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft."	1036	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8H9Q-rYVRrwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

630	We Need To Talk About Kevin	Lionel Shriver	2010	WINNER OF THE WOMEN'S PRIZE FOR FICTION 2010 ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD Eva never really wanted to be a mother; certainly not the mother of a boy named Kevin who murdered seven of his fellow high school students, a cafeteria worker and a teacher who had tried to befriend him. Now, two years after her son's horrific rampage, Eva comes to terms with her role as Kevin's mother in a series of startlingly direct correspondences with her absent husband Franklyn about their son's upbringing. Fearing that her own shortcomings may have shaped what her son has become, she confesses to a deep, long-standing ambivalence about motherhood. How much is her fault? In Lionel Shriver's hands this sensational, chilling and memorable story of a woman who raised a monster becomes a metaphor for the larger tragedy - the tragedy of a country where everything works, nobody starves, and anything can be bought but a sense of purpose.	480	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GNp0SptFYg8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In his intensity he can dominate the play, challenging abrasively its romantic and lyrical affirmations. What results is a bitter-sweet drama.

661	House of Leaves	Mark Z. Danielewski	2000	"THE MIND-BENDING CULT CLASSIC ABOUT A HOUSE THAT’S LARGER ON THE INSIDE THAN ON THE OUTSIDE • A masterpiece of horror and an astonishingly immersive, maze-like reading experience that redefines the boundaries of a novel. ''Simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious."" —Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ""Thrillingly alive, sublimely creepy, distressingly scary, breathtakingly intelligent—it renders most other fiction meaningless."" —Bret Easton Ellis, bestselling author of American Psycho “This demonically brilliant book is impossible to ignore.” —Jonathan Lethem, award-winning author of Motherless Brooklyn One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children. Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games. Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams."	738	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qGA_3RGqTkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships—but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees. That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor—and well-known ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding...six-pack abs. Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.	401	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OuY9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

681	Oedipus Rex	Sophocles	2017	"""...what man wins more happiness than just its shape and the ruin when that shape collapses?"" Sophocles' Oedipus Rex has never been surpassed for the raw and terrible power with which its hero struggles to answer the eternal question, ""Who am I?"" The play, a story of a king who acting entirely in ignorance kills his father and marries his mother, unfolds with shattering power; we are helplessly carried along with Oedipus towards the final, horrific truth. To make Oedipus more accessible for the modern reader, our Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Classics includes a glossary of the more difficult words, as well as convenient sidebar notes to enlighten the reader on aspects that may be confusing or overlooked. We hope that the reader may, through this edition, more fully enjoy the beauty of the verse, the wisdom of the insights, and the impact of the drama. About Sophocles : Sophocles (born c. 496 bc, Colonus, near Athens [Greece]-died 406, Athens), was an ancient Greek tragedy playwright. Not many things are known about his life other than that he was wealthy, well educated and wrote about one hundred and twenty three plays (of which few are extant). One of his best known plays is 'Oedipus the King' (Oedipus Rex). "" What can I say about Sophocles' Oedipus Rex that has not already been said? Apart from the patricide and the infamous incest, this is an ancient tale of angst and overall calamity. But since I recently revisited it, this legendary tragedy hasn't left my mind. ""Look and learn all citizens of Thebes. This is Oedipus.He, who read the famous riddle, and we hailed chief of men,All envied his power, glory, and good fortune.Now upon his head the sea of disaster crashes down."" "" I felt after reading the play that there was not really anything that Oedipus could have done to get himself out of his destiny. In fact, it seems that the more he attempts to get out of it, the deeper he is immersed in its inevitability. It is simply that there was no way for him to avoid doing it all and facing his fate. After hearing of the prophecy he flees because he doesn't want it to come true, but there is a lot that he does not know and a lot that he is not being told. His parents, when told by the oracles decided to sacrifice him. But he was saved by the compassionate nature of humanity. Later on, his step parents also leave him in ignorance, and in hiding the truth they are also making the prophecy come true. """	156	en	
682	The MaddAddam Trilogy	Margaret Atwood	2013	From Booker Prize–winner and #1 national bestseller Margaret Atwood, The MaddAddam Trilogy is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. With breathtaking command of her brilliantly conceived material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, she projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter. In the tradition of The Handmaid’s Tale, Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood envision a near future that is both beyond our imagining and all too familiar: a world devastated by uncontrolled genetic engineering and a widespread plague, with only a few remaining humans fighting for survival. Combining adventure, humour, romance and superb storytelling that is at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, MaddAddam is a moving and dramatic conclusion to this internationally celebrated dystopian trilogy.	1232	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gdI9AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
683	Seabiscuit	Laura Hillenbrand	2001	Laura Hillenbrand, author of the runaway phenomenon Unbroken, brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story in this #1 New York Times bestseller. Seabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini. But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes: Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.

Koushun Takami's notorious high-octane thriller is based on an irresistible premise: a class of 42 junior high school students are taken to a deserted island where, as part of a ruthless authoritarian program, they are electronically collared, provided with weapons of varying potency, and sent out onto the island. If they are in the wrong part of the island at the wrong time, their collars will explode. If they band together to save themselves a collar will explode at random. If they try to escape from the island, they will be blown up. Their only chance for survival lies in killing their classmates.

The poem, which has been called ""arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American"", is largely responsible for some of the conceptions of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today, and has had a massive impact on the history of Christmas gift giving. Prior to the poem, American ideas about St. Nicholas and other Christmastide visitors varied considerably. It became a popular poem which was set to music and was recorded by many artists."	28	en

689	The Memory Keeper's Daughter	Kim Edwards	2006	A #1 New York Times bestseller by Kim Edwards, The Memory Keeper’s Daughter is a brilliantly crafted novel of parallel lives, familial secrets, and the redemptive power of love Kim Edwards’s stunning novel begins on a winter night in 1964 in Lexington, Kentucky, when a blizzard forces Dr. David Henry to deliver his own twins. His son, born first, is perfectly healthy, but the doctor immediately recognizes that his daughter has Down syndrome. Rationalizing it as a need to protect Norah, his wife, he makes a split second decision that will alter all of their lives forever. He asks his nurse, Caroline, to take the baby away to an institution and never to reveal the secret. Instead, she disappears into another city to raise the child herself. So begins this beautifully told story that unfolds over a quarter of a century—in which these two families, ignorant of each other, are yet bound by the fateful decision made that winter night long ago. A family drama, The Memory Keeper’s Daughter explores every mother's silent fear: What would happen if you lost your child and she grew up without you? It is also an astonishing tale of love and how the mysterious ties that hold a family together help us survive the heartache that occurs when long-buried secrets are finally uncovered.	434	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKWMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

691	A People's History of the United States	Howard Zinn	2010	“It’s a wonderful, splendid book—a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future.” —Howard Fast, author of Spartacus and The Immigrants “[It] should be required reading.” —Eric Foner, New York Times Book Review Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s iconic A People's History of the United States “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.” Packed with vivid details and telling quotations, Zinn’s award-winning classic continues to revolutionize the way American history is taught and remembered. Frequent appearances in popular media such as The Sopranos, The Simpsons, Good Will Hunting, and the History Channel documentary The People Speak testify to Zinn’s ability to bridge the generation gap with enduring insights into the birth, development, and destiny of the nation.	763	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-RBeJ0rU5KkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It tells the story of Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus as seen from the perspective of Professor Pierre Aronnax.

Professor Pierre Aronnax, a noted French marine biologist and narrator of the story, who happens to be in New York at the time and is a recognized expert in his field, is issued a last-minute invitation to join the expedition, and he accepts.

693	Verity	Colleen Hoover	2021	Mais um romance de sucesso. Verity é perturbador, arrepiante e inesperado. Uma experiência inesquecível. Lowen Ashleigh é uma escritora que se debate com grandes dificuldades financeiras, até que aceita uma oferta de trabalho irrecusável: terminar os três últimos volumes da série de sucesso de Verity Crawford, uma autora de renome que ficou incapacitada depois de um terrível acidente. Para poder entrar na cabeça de Verity e estudar as anotações e ideias reunidas ao longo de anos de trabalho, Lowen aceita o convite de Jeremy Crawford, marido da autora, e muda-se temporariamente para a casa deles. Mas o que ela não esperava encontrar no caótico escritório de Verity era a autobiografia inacabada da autora. Ao lê-la, percebe que esta não se destinava a ser partilhada com ninguém. São páginas e páginas de confissões arrepiantes, incluindo as memórias de Verity relativas ao dia da morte da filha. Lowen decide ocultar de Jeremy a existência do manuscrito, sabendo que o seu conteúdo destroçaria aquele pai, já em tão grande sofrimento. Mas, à medida que os sentimentos de Lowen por Jeremy se intensificam, ela apercebe-se de que talvez seja melhor ele ler as palavras escritas por Verity. Afinal de contas, por mais dedicado que Jeremy seja à sua mulher doente, uma verdade tão horrenda faria com que fosse impossível ele continuar a amá-la.

She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks . . . until something extraordinary happens. “A seductive mix of Celtic mythology and dark, sexy danger.”—Chicago Tribune When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death–a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed—a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .

709	Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead	Tom Stoppard	2007	Acclaimed as a modern dramatic masterpiece, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead is the fabulously inventive tale of Hamlet as told from the worm’s-eve view of the bewildered Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters in Shakespeare’s play. In Tom Stoppard’s best-known work, this Shakespearean Laurel and Hardy finally get a chance to take the lead role, but do so in a world where echoes of Waiting for Godot resound, where reality and illusion intermix, and where fate leads our two heroes to a tragic but inevitable end. Tom Stoppard was catapulted into the front ranks of modem playwrights overnight when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead opened in London in 1967. Its subsequent run in New York brought it the same enthusiastic acclaim, and the play has since been performed numerous times in the major theatrical centers of the world. It has won top honors for play and playwright in a poll of London Theater critics, and in its printed form it was chosen one of the “Notable Books of 1967” by the American Library Association.	134	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RC6JJmB_JEcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In the ten years since her extraordinary debut novel, Outlander, was published, beloved author Diana Gabaldon has entertained scores of readers with her heart-stirring stories and remarkable characters. The four volumes of her bestselling saga, featuring eighteenth-century Scotsman James Fraser and his twentieth-century, time-travelling wife, Claire Randall, boasts nearly 5 million copies in the U.S. The story of Outlander begins just after the Second World War, when a British field nurse named Claire Randall walks through a cleft stone in the Scottish highlands and is transported back some two hundred years to 1743. Here, now, is The Fiery Cross, the eagerly awaited fifth volume in this remarkable, award-winning series of historical novels. The year is 1771, and war is approaching. Jamie Fraser’ s wife has told him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy – a time-traveller’s certain knowledge. To break his oath to the Crown will brand him a traitor; to keep it is certain doom. Jamie Fraser stands in the shadow of the fiery cross – a standard that leads nowhere but to the bloody brink of war.	1696	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KzSctgQjoOcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

719	The Miracle Ship	Brian O'hare	2014	YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE READING BUT EVERY WORD IS TRUE!! Do you believe in miracles? Do you believe in demonic possession? Do you believe in exorcism? A little girl with irreparable brain damage was pronounced dead by two hospital specialists. Today she is a healthy teenager. A teenage boy whose spine was crushed by a lorry was diagnosed as permanently paralysed. He now plays football with his friends. A curse that brought death over five generations has been lifted. People tormented by demons have been set free. How were such miracles wrought? What do they have in common? They have John Gillespie in common. Who is he? How has he been gifted with such extraordinary power? The Miracle Ship tells John's story. But it does so much more than that. Yes, the book essentially focuses on miracles. Yes, it contains many extraordinary stories of healing and deliverance. Yes, it focuses strongly on the spiritual warfare that so many Christians are engaged in without any awareness of its dangers. But the book goes to the very heart of what is needed to find healing and deliverance. It tells of the obstacles and difficulties that get in the way of true healing prayer. It reveals the many pitfalls that lie in wait in seemingly innocent healing practices. It spells out in detail the serious dangers that underpin many apparently beneficial New Age therapies. And it offers many examples of the kinds of prayers and life-styles that can bring healing to the body and to the mind. It can even turn around lives that are falling apart (and this has already been several times communicated to the author or John Gillespie by people who have already read this book on Kindle.) This is a book that should be read by all Christians. John's message is profoundly insightful and, if it is uncompromising, it is laced with faith, forgiveness and truth. Many who have already read the book have described it as 'life-changing.' This true account of his life, of the miracles and deliverances that follow his prayers, will amaze you. Millions of people love to hear and read about miracles. Sr. Briege McKenna's book Miracles Do Happen has sold all over the world in its millions. If you read and liked Miracles Do Happen, you'll love The Miracle Ship .	320	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=phizoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

723	A Breath of Snow and Ashes	Diana Gabaldon	2005	#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The sixth book in Diana Gabaldon’s acclaimed Outlander saga, the basis for the Starz original series. “The large scope of the novel allows Gabaldon to do what she does best, paint in exquisite detail the lives of her characters.”—Booklist The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest. With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence—with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.	994	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lpGbPIvMQK8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

726	One For The Money	Janet Evanovich	1999	Discover where it all began—the first “snappily written, fast-paced, and witty” (USA TODAY) novel in the beloved Stephanie Plum series featuring a feisty and funny heroine who “comes roaring in like a blast of very fresh air” (The Washington Post), from Janet Evanovich, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dirty Thirty. Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She’s a product of the “burg,” a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There’s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase should be interesting…and could also be extremely dangerous.	305	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iuc9opwJ7awC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

729	The Blind Assassin	Margaret Atwood	2010	“Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.” These words are spoken by Iris Chase Griffen, married at eighteen to a wealthy industrialist but now poor and eighty-two. Iris recalls her far from exemplary life, and the events leading up to her sister’s death, gradually revealing the carefully guarded Chase family secrets. Among these is “The Blind Assassin,” a novel that earned the dead Laura Chase not only notoriety but also a devoted cult following. Sexually explicit for its time, it was a pulp fantasy improvised by two unnamed lovers who meet secretly in rented rooms and seedy cafés. As this novel-within-a-novel twists and turns through love and jealousy, self-sacrifice and betrayal, so does the real narrative, as both move closer to war and catastrophe. Margaret Atwood’s Booker Prize-winning sensation combines elements of gothic drama, romantic suspense, and science fiction fantasy in a spellbinding tale.	578	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6AXhWb6UI-8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But something is missing in her life. So, one cold November morning, she takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up. But she does -- at a mental hospital where she is told that she has only days to live. Inspired by events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal.

738	Freakonomics	Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner	2009	Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? How much do parents really matter? These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He studies the riddles of everyday life-from cheating and crime to parenting and sports-and reaches conclusions that turn conventional wisdom on its head. Freakonomics is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They set out to explore the inner workings of a crack gang, the truth about real estate agents, the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, and much more. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, they show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives-how people get what they want or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing.	366	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mXQVbIRkHegC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

According to Mormon belief, The Book of Mormon was inscribed on golden plates by generations of prophets, quoted and abridged by the prophet-historian Mormon, and buried in the ground by Mormon's son, Moroni. Fourteen centuries later, in 1823, the angel Moroni led Joseph Smith to the plates hidden in a hillside in upstate New York. Smith translated the ancient language into English through divine revelation. The Book of Mormon narrates the historical, religious, political, and military events that shaped and continue to inform the Church's teachings. The publication of this edition offers the opportunity to explore one of the largest denominations in America today. - Back cover.	0	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hrSAuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
764	The Elegance of the Hedgehog	Muriel Barbery	2008	The phenomenal New York Times bestseller that “explores the upstairs-downstairs goings-on of a posh Parisian apartment building” (Publishers Weekly). In an elegant hôtel particulier in Paris, Renée, the concierge, is all but invisible—short, plump, middle-aged, with bunions on her feet and an addiction to television soaps. Her only genuine attachment is to her cat, Leo. In short, she’s everything society expects from a concierge at a bourgeois building in an upscale neighborhood. But Renée has a secret: She furtively, ferociously devours art, philosophy, music, and Japanese culture. With biting humor, she scrutinizes the lives of the tenants—her inferiors in every way except that of material wealth. Paloma is a twelve-year-old who lives on the fifth floor. Talented and precocious, she’s come to terms with life’s seeming futility and decided to end her own on her thirteenth birthday. Until then, she will continue hiding her extraordinary intelligence behind a mask of mediocrity, acting the part of an average pre-teen high on pop culture, a good but not outstanding student, an obedient if obstinate daughter. Paloma and Renée hide their true talents and finest qualities from a world they believe cannot or will not appreciate them. But after a wealthy Japanese man named Ozu arrives in the building, they will begin to recognize each other as kindred souls, in a novel that exalts the quiet victories of the inconspicuous among us, and “teaches philosophical lessons by shrewdly exposing rich secret lives hidden beneath conventional exteriors” (Kirkus Reviews). “The narrators’ kinetic minds and engaging voices (in Alison Anderson’s fluent translation) propel us ahead.” —The New York Times Book Review “Barbery’s sly wit . . . bestows lightness on the most ponderous cogitations.” —The New Yorker	282	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J8S2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Her family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was still a way home. “Beautiful and propulsive . . .

778	The Story of My Life	Helen Keller	2015	At the tender age of nineteen months, Helen Keller contracted a disease that severely impaired her hearing and sight. After seeking help from several people, she was finally directed to the Perkins Institute for the Blind, where she met Anne Sullivan, a woman who would change her life. Anne's unorthodox teaching methods and her steadfast determination to reach out to other people helped Helen learn to speak, and read and write Braille. Eventually, she became an inspirational speaker, an advocate for those physically challenged, a socialist, pacifist and suffragist. This memoir, written while Helen was a student at Radcliffe College (she went on to become the first blind person to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree) is an inspirational and moving account of a girl who triumphs over odds that might seem impossible to most, with the help and support of her 'teacher', Anne Sullivan.	132	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0lUFjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
779	The Magic Mountain	Thomas Mann	2005	A monumental work of erudition and irony, sexual tension and intellectual ferment, The Magic Mountain is an enduring classic • Acclaimed translator John E. Woods has given us the definitive English version of Mann’s masterpiece, presented here in a stunning hardcover edition. With this dizzyingly rich novel of ideas, Thomas Mann rose to the front ranks of the great modern novelists, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929. The Magic Mountain takes place in an exclusive tuberculosis sanatorium in the Swiss Alps—a community devoted to sickness that serves as a fictional microcosm for Europe in the days before the First World War. To this hermetic and otherworldly realm comes Hans Castorp, an “ordinary young man” who arrives for a short visit and ends up staying for seven years, during which he succumbs both to the lure of eros and to the intoxication of ideas. Everyman's Library pursues the highest production standards, printing on acid-free cream-colored paper, with full-cloth cases with two-color foil stamping, decorative endpapers, silk ribbon markers, European-style half-round spines, and a full-color illustrated jacket. Contemporary Classics include an introduction, a select bibliography, and a chronology of the author's life and times.	905	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cuMEllGGLdgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Determined to succeed at life—which means getting into the right high school to get into the right college to get the right job—Craig studies night and day to ace the entrance exam, and does. That’s when things start to get crazy. At his new school, Craig realizes that he isn't brilliant compared to the other kids; he’s just average, and maybe not even that. He soon sees his once-perfect future crumbling away. The stress becomes unbearable and Craig stops eating and sleeping—until, one night, he nearly kills himself. Craig’s suicidal episode gets him checked into a mental hospital, where his new neighbors include a transsexual sex addict, a girl who has scarred her own face with scissors, and the self-elected President Armelio. There, isolated from the crushing pressures of school and friends, Craig is finally able to confront the sources of his anxiety.

The only trouble is, she can’t actually afford it—not any of it. Her job writing at Successful Saving magazine not only bores her to tears, it doesn’t pay much at all. And lately Becky’s been chased by dismal letters from the bank—letters with large red sums she can’t bear to read. She tries cutting back. But none of her efforts succeeds. Her only consolation is to buy herself something . . . just a little something. Finally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life—and the lives of those around her—forever.

After almost fifty years as a wife and mother, Enid Lambert is ready to have some fun. Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson’s disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself that, despite certain alarming indicators, he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man—or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.	577	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FodGfz5li5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

795	Three Theban Plays	Sophocles	2004	The story of Oedipus has captured the human imagination as few others. It is the story of a man fated to kill his father and marry his mother, a man who by a cruel irony brings these things to pass by his very efforts to avoid them. But these plays are not about fate, and not about irony. They are about character, choice and consequence. In Antigone we see a woman who will defy human law, and die for it, rather than transgress the eternal, unwritten laws of the gods. Oedipus the Tyrant is the story of a ruler destroyed by those qualities - pride, determination and belief in his own abilities - which made him ruler in the first place. Finally, in Oedipus at Colonus, written late in Sophocles' life, the aged and blinded king achieves a personal reconciliation, but at a cost - a son who will die in battle against his country, and a daughter who will die burying her brother.	224	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8HO4FQ5Nv3cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

802	Ficciones	Jorge Luis Borges	2015	“Borges’s composed, carefully wrought, gnarled style is at once the means of his art and its object—his way of ordering and giving meaning to the bizarre and terrifying world he creates: it is a brilliant, burnished instrument, and it is quite adequate to the extreme demands his baroque imagination makes of it . . . . Absolutely and most vividly original.”—Saturday Review The seventeen pieces in Ficciones demonstrate the gargantuan powers of imagination, intelligence, and style of one of the greatest writers of this or any other century. Borges sends us on a journey into a compelling, bizarre, and profoundly resonant realm; we enter the fearful sphere of Pascal’s abyss, the surreal and literal labyrinth of books, and the iconography of eternal return. More playful and approachable than the fictions themselves are Borges’s Prologues, brief elucidations that offer the uninitiated a passageway into the whirlwind of Borges’s genius and mirror the precision and potency of his intellect and inventiveness, his piercing irony, his skepticism, and his obsession with fantasy. To enter the worlds in Ficciones is to enter the mind of Jorge Luis Borges, wherein lies Heaven, Hell, and everything in between.	184	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E1SCCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

But the moment I meet Archer Hale, my entire world tilts on its axis . . . and never rights itself again.

The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work.

From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture.

The book is in part a happy tribute to the 'life' that her love for Vita Sackville-West had breathed into Virginia Woolf's own day-to-day existence; it is also Woolf's light-hearted and light-handed teasing out of the assumptions that lie behind the normal conventions for writing about a fictional or historical life.

For the Burroughs enthusiast and the neophyte, this volume—that contains final-draft typescripts, numerous unpublished contemporaneous writings by Burroughs, his own later introductions to the book, and his essay on psychoactive drugs—is a valuable and fresh experience of a novel that has lost none of its relevance or satirical bite.	312	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MlvMaAKiobgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ten years ago, Michael Pollan confronted us with this seemingly simple question and, with The Omnivore’s Dilemma, his brilliant and eye-opening exploration of our food choices, demonstrated that how we answer it today may determine not only our health but our survival as a species. In the years since, Pollan’s revolutionary examination has changed the way Americans think about food. Bringing wide attention to the little-known but vitally important dimensions of food and agriculture in America, Pollan launched a national conversation about what we eat and the profound consequences that even the simplest everyday food choices have on both ourselves and the natural world.

821	Chasing the Devil	Tim Butcher	2010	For many years Sierra Leone and Liberia have been too dangerous to travel through, bedevilled by a uniquely brutal form of violence from which sprang many of Africa's cruellest contemporary icons - child soldiers, prisoner mutilation, blood diamonds. With their wars officially over, Tim Butcher sets out on a journey across both countries, trekking for 350 miles through remote rainforest and malarial swamps. Just as he followed H M Stanley through the Congo - a journey described in his bestseller Blood River - this time he pursues a trail blazed by Graham Greene in 1935 and immortalised in the travel classic Journey Without Maps. Greene took 26 bearers, a case of scotch, and hammocks in which he and his cousin Barbara were carried. Tim walks every blistering inch to gain an extraordinary ground-level view of a troubled and overlooked region. As a journalist in Africa, Tim came to know both countries well although the wars made trips to the jungle hinterland far too risky. This is where he now heads, exploring how rebel groups thrived in the bush for so long and whether the devil of war has truly been chased away. He encounters other 'devils', masked figures guarding the spiritual secrets of jungle communities. Some are no more threatening than schoolmasters but others are much more sinister, relying on ritual cannibalism as a source of their magical power. Tim encounters these devils on an epic journey that demands courage, doggedness and good fortune. Chasing the Devil is a dramatic travel book touching on one of the most fraught parts of the globe at a unique moment in its history. Weaving history and anthropology with personal narrative - as well as new discoveries about Greene - it is as exciting as it is enlightening.	340	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JyOSugSth-gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

825	Mary Poppins, She Wrote	Valerie Lawson	2013	"The story of Mary Poppins, the quintessentially English and utterly magical children's nanny, is remarkable enough. She flew into the lives of the unsuspecting Banks family in a children's book that was instantly hailed as a classic, then became a household name when Julie Andrews stepped into the starring role in Walt Disney's hugely successful and equally classic film. Now she is a sensation all over again-both on Broadway and in Disney's upcoming film Saving Mr. Banks. Saving Mr. Banksretells many of the stories in Valerie Lawson's biography Mary Poppins, She Wrote, including P. L. Travers's move from London to Hollywood and her struggles with Walt Disney as he adapted her novel for the big screen. Travers, whom Disney accused of vanity for ""thinking she knows more about Mary Poppins than I do,"" was a poet and world-renowned author as tart and opinionated as Andrews's big-screen Mary Poppins was cheery and porcelain-beautiful. Yet it was a love of mysticism and magic that shaped Travers's life as well as the very character of Mary Poppins. The clipped, strict, and ultimately mysterious nanny who emerged from her pen was the creation of someone who remained inscrutable and enigmatic to the end of her ninety-six years. Valerie Lawson's illuminating biography provides the first full look at the life of the woman and writer whose personal journey is as intriguing as her beloved characters."	416	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8tQyAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

832	Howards End	E. M. Forster	1991	"First published in 1910, Howards End is the novel that earned E. M. Forster recognition as a major writer. Soon to be a limited series on Starz. At its heart lie two families—the wealthy and business-minded Wilcoxes and the cultured and idealistic Schlegels. When the beautiful and independent Helen Schlegel begins an impetuous affair with the ardent Paul Wilcox, a series of events is sparked—some very funny, some very tragic—that results in a dispute over who will inherit Howards End, the Wilcoxes' charming country home. As much about the clash between individual wills as the clash between the sexes and the classes, Howards End is a novel whose central tenet, ""Only connect,"" remains a powerful prescription for modern life.

833	Mort	Terry Pratchett	2009	New York Times bestselling author Terry Pratchett makes Death a central character in Mort, a fabulous installment in Discworld, the fantasy cosmos where even the angel of darkness needs some assistance. Death comes to everyone eventually on Discworld. And now he's come to Mort with an offer the young man can't refuse. (No, literally, can't refuse since being dead isn't exactly compulsory.) Actually, it's a pretty good deal. As Death's apprentice, Mort will have free board and lodging. He'll get use of the company horse. And he won't have to take any time off for family funerals. But despite the obvious perks, young Mort is about to discover that there is a serious downside to working for the Reaper Man . . . because this perfect job can be a killer on one's love life. Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent, bestselling novels have garnered him a revered position in the halls of parody next to the likes of Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.	292	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ghsV4BTngg4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

838	Meditations	Marcus Aurelius	2002	NATIONAL BESTSELLER • Timeless insights into what it takes to lead a meaningful life—still profoundly relevant nearly two thousand years later. Now featuring a brand-new foreword from Ryan Holiday, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Way! “Meditations offers a glimpse into [Marcus Aurelius’s] mind, his habits, and his approach to life. . . . I think any reader would find something useful to take away from it.”—James Clear, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Atomic Habits “It is unbelievable to see how the emperor’s words have stood the test of time. . . . Read a page or two anytime you feel like the world is too much.”—Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Wall Street Journal Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. With bite-size insights and advice on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others, Meditations has become required reading not only for statesmen and philosophers alike, but also for generations of readers who responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. In Gregory Hays’s translation—the first in nearly four decades—Marcus’s thoughts speak with a new immediacy. In fresh and unencumbered English, Hays vividly conveys the spareness and compression of the original Greek text. Never before have Marcus’s insights been so directly and powerfully presented. With an Introduction that outlines Marcus’s life and career, the essentials of Stoic doctrine, the style and construction of the Meditations, and the work’s ongoing influence, this edition makes it possible to fully rediscover the thoughts of one of the most enlightened and intelligent leaders of any era.	258	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=24a_o-VJvGsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

850	Tender is the Night	F. Scott Fitzgerald	2022	"F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Tender Is the Night"" is a profound exploration of the disintegration of American wealth and morality set against the backdrop of the glamorous expatriate life in Europe during the 1920s. The novel employs a rich tapestry of lyrical prose and innovative narrative structure, oscillating between past and present to delve into the complexities of identity, ambition, and the fragility of human relationships. Its poignant portrayal of Dick Diver, a charismatic psychiatrist, and his unraveling marriage to the psychologically troubled heiress Nicole Warren reflects the broader themes of the American Dream's decay amidst the moral ambiguities of a post-World War I society. Fitzgerald's work embodies the modernist literary movement, characterized by its experimentation and deep psychological insight. Fitzgerald, a key figure of the Jazz Age, drew from his own tumultuous experiences and observations of the elite class to craft this semi-autobiographical novel. His relationship with Zelda Sayre, who battled her own mental health issues, undoubtedly inspired the characters' intricate dynamics and emotional struggles. The accolades and criticisms surrounding Fitzgerald's life amplified his perpetual fascination with the intersections of love, beauty, and despair, as portrayed through Dick and Nicole's tumultuous journey. ""Tender Is the Night"" is a captivating read for those who seek to understand the intricacies of human desires and disillusionments. Its exploration of mental health, identity, and the dissolution of the American Dream invites profound reflection and understanding. Readers are encouraged to engage with Fitzgerald's evocative prose and multilayered narrative, making it an essential addition to the canon of American literature."	329	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zop_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk. Two and a half years after an unspeakable tragedy left her a shadow of the girl she once was, Nastya Kashnikov moves to a new town determined to keep her dark past hidden and hold everyone at a distance.

Every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. When your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space. Everyone except Nastya who won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But as the undeniable pull between them intensifies, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding—or if he even wants to. The Sea of Tranquility is a rich, intense, and brilliantly imagined story about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the mira­cle of second chances.	448	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D0D1DMc-vcsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

One of The Atlantic’s Great American Novels of the Past 100 Years “Read, read, read. Read everything—trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You’ll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you’ll find out. If it’s not, throw it out the window.” —William Faulkner Absalom, Absalom! is Faulkner’s epic tale of Thomas Sutpen, a man who comes to the South in the early 1830s to wrest his mansion out of the muddy bottoms of the north Mississippi wilderness. He was a man, Faulkner said, “who wanted sons and the sons destroyed him.”	322	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WYSLDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee.

The AT offers an astonishing landscape of silent forests and sparkling lakes—and to a writer with the comic genius of Bill Bryson, it also provides endless opportunities to witness the majestic silliness of his fellow human beings. For a start there’s the gloriously out-of-shape Stephen Katz, a buddy from Iowa along for the walk. But A Walk in the Woods is more than just a laugh-out-loud hike. Bryson’s acute eye is a wise witness to this beautiful but fragile trail, and as he tells its fascinating history, he makes a moving plea for the conservation of America’s last great wilderness. An adventure, a comedy, and a celebration, A Walk in the Woods is a modern classic of travel literature.

890	A Study in Scarlet, Sherlock Holmes #1, by Arthur Conan Doyle	Arthur Conan Doyle	2019	"A Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was first published in 1887. It is the first story to feature the character of Sherlock Holmes, who would later become one of the most famous and iconic literary detective characters, with long-lasting interest and appeal. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes to his companion Doctor Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his ""study in scarlet"": ""There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it."""	128	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rPnZywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
891	The Sorrows of Young Werther (with Audio & Text)	J. W. von Goethe	2021	The Sorrows of Young Werther is a epistolary novel by J. W. von Goethe. First published in 1774, it reappeared as a revised edition in 1787. It was one of the most important novels in the Sturm und Drang (“Storm and Stress”) period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic movement. The book's publication instantly placed the author among the foremost international literary celebrities, and was among the best known of his works. Goethe is, by some accounts, the father of the romantic period in literature, or at least the proto-romantic Sturm und Drang period. And The Sorrows of Young Werther was its genesis. While Voltaire parodied rationalism in Candide, Goethe transcended it with the semi-autobiographical story of Werther, a young man governed more by his emotions than his reason, whose only employment is his delight in the romantic ideals of the pastoral lives he finds in the rural town of Walheim. There he also finds Charlotte, and in her an idealized but unobtainable old-world domesticity. Werther’s internal dialog about his growing obsession with Charlotte, and his inability to cope rationally with the fact that she is engaged to—and in love with—another man, form the bulk of the book in the form of a series of ever more intense letters to a friend. Werther's descent into sorrow has captivated readers for centuries, helped by Goethe’s intensely beautiful prose, enchanting imagery, and obvious reverence for nature and a dying past.	163	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P0IzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

897	A Moveable Feast	Ernest Hemingway	2021	A Moveable Feast stands as Ernest Hemingway's poignant memoir of his years in Paris during the 1920s, shedding light on both his personal and artistic journey. With Hemingway's characteristic terse prose and vivid imagery, the book captures the essence of a vibrant expatriate community, reflecting the juxtaposition of bohemian life and the quest for authenticity amidst the backdrop of historical Paris. The narrative intertwines retrospective musings with precise details of social interactions, effectively conveying the zeitgeist of a seminal period for modernist literature and art, while revealing the profound connections between the author and his contemporaries. Ernest Hemingway, an iconic figure of 20th-century literature, often drew on his own life experiences to develop his craft. A journalist by training and a veteran of two world wars, Hemingway's passion for storytelling is intricately linked to his personal struggles and successes. His encounters with literary giants like Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ezra Pound profoundly influenced his stylistic evolution, ultimately leading to the creation of A Moveable Feast, which serves as both a snapshot of his life and a tribute to a bygone era. This book is highly recommended for readers interested in the intersections of personal narrative and literary history. It offers not just a glimpse into the life of one of America's literary greats but also an immersive experience that encapsulates the spirit of a vibrant artistic landscape.

898	A Million Little Pieces	James Frey	2005	"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A gripping memoir about the nature of addiction and the meaning of recovery from a bold and talented literary voice. “Anyone who has ever felt broken and wished for a better life will find inspiration in Frey’s story.” —People “A great story.... You can't help but cheer his victory.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility’s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of detoxification and withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs’s Junky. But A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is—including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak—but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic’s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become—which runs directly counter to his counselors' recipes for recovery. James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, that is at the heart of A Million Little Pieces: the fight between one young man’s will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart.

On a burn ward, a man lies between living and dying, so disfigured that no one from his past life would even recognize him. His only comfort comes from imagining various inventive ways to end his misery. Then a woman named Marianne Engel walks into his hospital room, a wild-haired, schizophrenic sculptress on the lam from the psych ward upstairs, who insists that she knows him – that she has known him, in fact, for seven hundred years. She remembers vividly when they met, in another hospital ward at a convent in medieval Germany, when she was a nun and he was a wounded mercenary left to die. If he has forgotten this, he is not to worry: she will prove it to him. And so Marianne Engel begins to tell him their story, carving away his disbelief and slowly drawing him into the orbit and power of a word he'd never uttered: love.	498	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XjhVLCIziEkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

905	We	Yevgeny Zamyatin	2022	"Yevgeny Zamyatin's novel ""We"" presents a chilling vision of a dystopian future where individuality is suppressed for the sake of societal uniformity. Written in a fragmented, yet lyrical prose style, Zamyatin intricately weaves philosophical musings with a critique of totalitarianism, laying the groundwork for later dystopian literature. The narrative is set in a mathematically regulated society, where the protagonist, D-503, grapples with the conflict between conformity and the burgeoning desire for personal freedom. This bold exploration reflects the author's disillusionment with the early Soviet regime and the broader trends of industrialization and rationalization that characterized early 20th-century thought. Yevgeny Zamyatin (1884-1937), a Russian writer and a dissident voice, drew from his experiences and observations of the socio-political landscape of his time to compose this pioneering work. His background in engineering and exposure to European intellectual ideas enriched his perspective on the relationship between the individual and the state, ultimately informing the satirical and cautionary tone of ""We."" Despite facing censorship and exile, Zamyatin's commitment to artistic integrity and personal freedom shines through in this bold narrative. For readers intrigued by the interplay of freedom and oppression, ""We"" is an essential read that resonates powerfully in contemporary discussions about surveillance, autonomy, and the cost of societal security. Zamyatin's visionary prose invites readers to reflect critically on the balance between individual rights and collective responsibility, making it a timeless classic in dystopian literature."	228	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YfdyEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

907	A Room Of One's Own	Virginia Woolf	2013	Based on a series of lectures delivered by author Virginia Woolf at women’s colleges, A Room of One’s Own is an essay that calls out for a broader representation of women writers in the literary world of Woolf’s time. Heralded as a call to action for women writers to carve out space both mentally and physically for their artistic endeavours, Woolf’s essay has become a cornerstone for modern feminism. Touching on subjects such as the importance of education, the history of female writers, and the taboo of lesbianism, Woolf constructs the unhealthy picture of the current reception for women’s work in literature, and passionately argues for the importance of the female voice.

913	Bartimaeus	Source Wikipedia	2013	Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online. Pages: 25. Chapters: Bartimaeus (book series), List of Bartimaeus characters, Magic in Bartimaeus, Ptolemy's Gate, The Amulet of Samarkand, The Golem's Eye, The Ring of Solomon. Excerpt: The following is a list of characters in the Bartimaeus series by Jonathan Stroud. One of the trio of major characters in the series. In the first book, The Amulet of Samarkand, he is a 12 year old boy who is a magician in training, great admirer of William Gladstone, and foils a coup organized by Simon Lovelace and saves the life of the Prime Minister, Rupert Devereaux. In the second book, The Golem's Eye, after assuming a post in the government, he works towards stopping insurgent attacks in London and also attempting to destroy a golem and unmask the identity of its master. In the third book, he is caught up in a revolution by the djinn on earth (mainly planned by Faquarl and Nouda), but ultimately manages to crush it. In this book, he also becomes aware of the corruptness of the magician government and he seems to desire separation from it and a return to his older and happier life. This is made significant when he faces his greatest fear (as the magician John Mandrake) and divulges his true name to Kitty Jones. Over the course of the trilogy, Nathaniel, the innocent young boy hungry for knowledge, is transformed into the arrogant John Mandrake. By the end of book three he becomes more responsible and honourable, more like his younger self. In his final moment, just before he sacrifices himself to kill the demon Nouda, he dismisses Bartimaeus, claiming that he would only botch the job and that dismissal would be the only way to get it right, although it is hinted by both Bartimaeus and Nathaniel that this is a last act of kindness and goodwill toward his long-suffering djinn. It is mentioned in Ptolemy's Gate that he is the strongest magician on...	26	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K50XngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Ralph Manheim’s pitch-perfect translation captures Céline’s savage energy, and a dynamic afterword by William T.

917	Stoner	John Williams	2019	Discover an American masterpiece. This unassuming story about the life of a quiet English professor has earned the admiration of readers all over the globe. William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude. John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.	337	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AiFOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

There, she is greeted by the two orphaned children she is to take care of, an ambiguous housekeeper, and an icy, supernatural atmosphere. Soon, a couple of peculiar figures begin to appear unannounced, and a creeping horror tightens its grip on both the governess and the reader. The Turn of the Screw is one of the most classic ghost stories of all time, written by the master of the psychological novel, Henry James. Perhaps more than anyone from his time, James came to inspire our modern horror mythologies, from the image of innocence as evil to schizoid labyrinths a la Roman Polanski. HENRY JAMES [1843-1916] was born in New York but emigrated early to Europe. He is one of the most important names in Anglo-Saxon literature, renowned as a great stylist and as a link between the Victorian era and modernism. Among his most famous novels are The American [1877], Portrait of a Lady [1881], and especially The Turn of the Screw [1898].	128	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ov3lEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.	386	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GFevO-QxQDgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

It reveals the purpose of the moon, explains the difference between criminals and outlaws, examines the conflict between social activism and romantic individualism, and paints a portrait of contemporary society that includes powerful Arabs, exiled royalty, and pregnant cheerleaders.

In the near future, enormous silver spaceships appear without warning over mankind’s largest cities. They belong to the Overlords, an alien race far superior to humanity in technological development. Their purpose is to dominate Earth. Their demands, however, are surprisingly benevolent: end war, poverty, and cruelty. Their presence, rather than signaling the end of humanity, ushers in a golden age . . . or so it seems. Without conflict, human culture and progress stagnate. As the years pass, it becomes clear that the Overlords have a hidden agenda for the evolution of the human race that may not be as benevolent as it seems. “Frighteningly logical, believable, and grimly prophetic . . .

936	Sometimes a Great Notion	Ken Kesey	2006	"The magnificent second novel from the legendary author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Following the astonishing success of his first novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Ken Kesey wrote what Charles Bowden calls ""one of the few essential books written by an American in the last half century."" This wild-spirited tale tells of a bitter strike that rages through a small lumber town along the Oregon coast. Bucking that strike out of sheer cussedness are the Stampers. Out of the Stamper family's rivalries and betrayals Ken Kesey has crafted a novel with the mythic impact of Greek tragedy.

947	The House of Mirth	Edith Wharton	1984	An immensely popular bestseller upon its publication in 1905, The House of Mirth was Edith Wharton’s first great novel. Set among the elegant brownstones of New York City and opulent country houses like gracious Bellomont on the Hudson, the novel creates a satiric portrayal of what Wharton herself called “a society of irresponsible pleasure-seekers” with a precision comparable to that of Proust. And her brilliant and complex characterization of the doomed Lily Bart, whose stunning beauty and dependence on marriage for economic survival reduce her to a decorative object, becomes an incisive commentary on the nature and status of women in that society. From her tragic attraction to bachelor lawyer Lawrence Selden to her desperate relationship with social-climbing Rosedale, Lily is all too much a product of the world indicated by the title, a phrase taken from Ecclesiastes: “The heart of fools is in the house of mirth.” For it is Lily’s very specialness that threatens the elegance and fulfillment she seeks in life. Along with the author’s other masterpiece, The Age of Innocence, this novel claims a place among the finest American novels of manners.	466	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kfdvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane.

But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage.

953	Beauty	Robin McKinley	2014	The New York Times–bestselling author of Rose Daughter reimagines the classic French fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast. I was the youngest of three daughters. Our literal-minded mother named us Grace, Hope, and Honour. . . . My father still likes to tell the story of how I acquired my odd nickname: I had come to him for further information when I first discovered that our names meant something besides you-come-here. He succeeded in explaining grace and hope, but he had some difficulty trying to make the concept of honour understandable to a five-year-old. . . . I said: ‘Huh! I’d rather be Beauty.’ . . . By the time it was evident that I was going to let the family down by being plain, I’d been called Beauty for over six years. . . . I wasn’t really very fond of my given name, Honour, either . . . as if ‘honourable’ were the best that could be said of me. The sisters’ wealthy father loses all his money when his merchant fleet is drowned in a storm, and the family moves to a village far away. Then the old merchant hears what proves to be a false report that one of his ships had made it safe to harbor at last, and on his sad, disappointed way home again he becomes lost deep in the forest and has a terrifying encounter with a fierce Beast, who walks like a man and lives in a castle. The merchant’s life is forfeit, says the Beast, for trespass and the theft of a rose—but he will spare the old man’s life if he sends one of his daughters: “Your daughter would take no harm from me, nor from anything that lives in my lands.” When Beauty hears this story—for her father had picked the rose to bring to her—her sense of honor demands that she take up the Beast’s offer, for “cannot a Beast be tamed?” This “splendid story” by the Newbery Medal–winning author of The Hero and the Crown has been named an ALA Notable Book and a Phoenix Award Honor Book (Publishers Weekly).	165	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0BPNBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

957	On the Beach	Nevil Shute Norway	2022	"In ""On the Beach,"" Nevil Shute Norway crafts a haunting and poignant narrative set in a post-apocalyptic world following a nuclear catastrophe. The novel employs a stark yet lyrical prose style, encapsulating the bleakness of a dying planet while simultaneously exploring the resilience of the human spirit. Through the interwoven lives of its characters—each navigating the harrowing reality of impending oblivion—Shute deftly examines themes of love, loss, and acceptance in the face of existential dread. The novel stands as a significant work within the literary genre of dystopian fiction, reflecting the anxieties of the Cold War era and the very real threat of nuclear annihilation that permeated public consciousness during the 1950s. Nevil Shute, an English novelist and aeronautical engineer, drew upon his personal experiences and profound understanding of human nature to craft this powerful narrative. His engineering background and the tumultuous historical context of World War II and the atomic bomb significantly influenced his perspective on the fragility of life and the moral implications of technological advancement. Shute's intimate grasp of human emotions renders his exploration of despair and hope all the more poignant. ""On the Beach"" is an essential read for those intrigued by the moral dilemmas of humanity and the legacies of war. Its profound insight into human relationships amid terminal uncertainty resonates deeply in today's complex world and encourages readers to reflect on their interconnectedness and the value of life itself."	266	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fn5_EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

963	On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous	Ocean Vuong	2021	A New York Times bestseller • Nominated for the National Book Award for Fiction • Ocean Vuong’s debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling New York Times Readers Pick: 100 Best Books of the 21st Century • A Kirkus Reviews Best Fiction Book of the Century “A lyrical work of self-discovery that’s shockingly intimate and insistently universal…Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning.” —Ron Charles, The Washington Post “This is one of the best novels I’ve ever read...Ocean Vuong is a master. This book a masterpiece.”—Tommy Orange, author of There There and Wandering Stars On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family’s history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one’s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

A stunning performance from one of our most intelligent novelists.”—The New Republic The inspiration for the award-winning major motion picture starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig Jack Gladney teaches Hitler Studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America where his colleagues include New York expatriates who want to immerse themselves in “American magic and dread.” Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the usual rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud floats over their lives, an “airborne toxic event” unleashed by an industrial accident. The menacing cloud is a more urgent and visible version of the “white noise” engulfing the Gladney family—radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, ultrasonic appliances, and TV murmurings—pulsing with life, yet suggesting something ominous.	321	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IRFvDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
969	Helter Skelter	Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry	2001	"The #1 True Crime Bestseller of All Time—7 Million Copies Sold In the summer of 1969, in Los Angeles, a series of brutal, seemingly random murders captured headlines across America. A famous actress (and her unborn child), an heiress to a coffee fortune, a supermarket owner and his wife were among the seven victims. A thin trail of circumstances eventually tied the Tate-LeBianca murders to Charles Manson, a would-be pop singer of small talent living in the desert with his ""family"" of devoted young women and men. What was his hold over them? And what was the motivation behind such savagery? In the public imagination, over time, the case assumed the proportions of myth. The murders marked the end of the sixties and became an immediate symbol of the dark underside of that era. Vincent Bugliosi was the prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, and this book is his enthralling account of how he built his case from what a defense attorney dismissed as only ""two fingerprints and Vince Bugliosi."" The meticulous detective work with which the story begins, the prosecutor's view of a complex murder trial, the reconstruction of the philosophy Manson inculcated in his fervent followers…these elements make for a true crime classic. Helter Skelter is not merely a spellbinding murder case and courtroom drama but also, in the words of The New Republic, a ""social document of rare importance."""	697	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cwf7fqxjRigC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

In Everything, Everything, Maddy is a girl who’s literally allergic to the outside world, and Olly is the boy who moves in next door . . . and becomes the greatest risk she’s ever taken. ""This extraordinary first novel about love so strong it might kill us is too good to feel like a debut. Tender, creative, beautifully written, and with a great twist, Everything, Everything is one of the best books I've read this year.""—Jodi Picoult My disease is as rare as it is famous. Basically, I’m allergic to the world. I don’t leave my house, have not left my house in seventeen years. The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla. But then one day, a moving truck arrives next door. I look out my window, and I see him. He's tall, lean and wearing all black—black T-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers, and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly. It’s almost certainly going to be a disaster.

976	Light in August	William Faulkner	2002	Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time From the Modern Library’s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner—also available are Snopes, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Absalom, Absalom!, and Selected Short Stories One of William Faulkner’s most admired and accessible novels, Light in August reveals the great American author at the height of his powers. Lena Grove’s resolute search for the father of her unborn child begets a rich, poignant, and ultimately hopeful story of perseverance in the face of mortality. It also acquaints us with several of Faulkner’s most unforgettable characters, including the Reverend Gail Hightower, plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen, and Joe Christmas, a ragged, itinerant soul obsessed with his mixed-race ancestry. Powerfully entwining these characters’ stories, Light in August brings to life Faulkner’s imaginary South, one of literature’s great invented landscapes, in all of its unerringly fascinating glory. Along with a new Foreword by C. E. Morgan, this edition reproduces the corrected text of Light in August as established in 1985 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk.	498	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LFH-uwPLB8wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.	465	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hi17DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

990	A Doll’s House	Henrik Ibsen	2023	This edition of one of the Western canon’s most iconic plays brings back into print the pivotal 1890 translation by William Archer. It was this translation that was largely responsible for the huge impact that A Doll’s House had in the English-speaking world, igniting as it did, in the words of one critic, “a firestorm of critical debate and dissent” about marriage and women’s rights. Accompanying the comprehensively annotated text of the play is a substantial introduction that combines critical analysis with biographical and historical context. An extensive series of appendices provides extracts from contemporary adaptations of A Doll’s House; writings by William Archer and Bernard Shaw about the play; reviews of early productions in London, New York, Montreal, and Sydney; contemporary documents relating to Ibsen and feminism; and views of actresses on playing the role of Nora.	314	en	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7UPkEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
991	The Tempest	William Shakespeare	2018	"Read & Co. Classics presents this new beautiful edition of William Shakespeare's play, ""The Tempest”. Featuring a specially commissioned new biography of William Shakespeare, it is a must for Shakespeare enthusiasts and newcomers alike. “The Tempest” is a story about Prospero, a wronged man, and his retribution. Left isolated on an island with his daughter, Miranda, he seeks to punish his enemies. Commanding the elements with magic, he conjures a storm, shipwrecking his suspected wrongdoers. As the castaways wash up onto his shores, they discover the island is far from normal.
